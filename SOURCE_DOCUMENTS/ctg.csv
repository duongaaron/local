The second question assesses perceptions of current treatment using the same two options. The outcome is a dichotomous variable of whether the preference matches the report of care received. Although this creates a ""false dichotomy"" in that many patients want both, this ""forced choice"" helps identify patients' top priority.

NCT04635852,Fentanyl Buccal Tablet for the Relief of Episodic Breathlessness in Cancer Patients,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04635852,EFFENDYS,COMPLETED,"""Episodic breathlessness (or dyspnea) is one form of chronic refractory breathlessness characterized by a severe worsening of breathlessness intensity or unpleasantness beyond usual fluctuations in the patient's perception. Episodes are time-limited (seconds to hours) and occur intermittently, with or without underlying continuous breathlessness. Episodes may be predictable or unpredictable, depending on whether any trigger(s) can be identified. There is a range of known triggers which can interact (e.g. exertion, emotions, comorbidities or external environment). One episode can be caused by one or more triggers."" ( definition by an international expert consensus \[Simon et al. 2013\]). Approximately half of patients with cancer complain about breathlessness with the highest prevalence in pulmonary malignancies. Episodic breathlessness is reported by 81% of breathless cancer patients with significant impairment on quality of life and limitations on activity. Although episodic breathlessness show some similar characteristics like episodes of pain (breakthrough cancer pain, BTCP; median duration 30minutes), they are often shorter: 91% last less than 20minutes (min). Other evidence supports these findings with duration between 2-15minutes which is a real challenge for the treatment of episodic breathlessness. In the majority of cases, episodic breathlessness occur 1-4 times per day and peak intensity is rated moderate or severe.

There is evidence for the effectiveness of opioids for the relief of chronic refractory breathlessness. There is no evaluated and proven standard treatment for the relief of episodic breathlessness at the moment but immediate-release morphine (IRM) as solution or tablet is most frequently used in clinical practice to treat episodic breathlessness. Time to onset of action of IRM is about 20-30min for pain. Fentanyl is a potent opioid and shows good evidence for the treatment of BTCP through its quick onset of action (5-15min) and short duration of action (50-60min). Because of its pharmacodynamic properties fentanyl might be appropriate and effective for the relief of episodic breathlessness. However, the efficacy of fentanyl for the relief of breathlessness and time to onset is unknown.

NCT03650205,Ivabradine to Prevent Anthracycline-induced Cardiotoxicity,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03650205,IPAC,UNKNOWN,"Anthracyclines are associated with cardiotoxic effects. Previous studies suggest that enalapril, and or carvedilol, protect against cardiovascular effects of these drugs.

Ivabradine selectively reduces heart rate through inhibition of the cardiac pace maker IF channel, thus prolonging the duration of spontaneous depolarization in the sinus node.

NCT00001452,Defining the Genetic Basis for the Development of Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease (PPNAD) and the Carney Complex,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001452,,COMPLETED,"Lentiginosis refers to groups of diseases marked by the presence of pigmented spots on the skin. These conditions are most commonly associated with multiple tumors and changes in hormone producing glands. The cause of these diseases is unknown, but researchers suggest there may be a level of inheritance involved in their development. Meaning to say that some of these diseases may ""run in the family"" and be passed down form generation to generation.

Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) is a pituitary-independent, primary adrenal form of hypercortisolism characterized by;

1. Resistance to suppression by the drug dexamethasone
2. The body is unable to secrete cortisol in a normal rhythm
3. Distinct microscopic changes of both adrenal glands

PPNAD can be associated with tumors (myxomas) of the skin, heart, breast, tumors (swannomas) of the nerve sheaths, pigmented spots (nevi and lentigines) of the skin, growth hormone (GH) producing tumors of the pituitary gland, and tumors of the testicles, ovaries, and thyroid gland. In the presence of these associations the condition is referred to as the Carney Complex. Presently there are no tests for screening of PPNAD and the Carney Complex. In addition, it is unknown how these conditions are genetically transferred from generation to generation.

This study proposes to use standard methods of clinical testing for endocrine and nonendocrine diseases and genetic testing in order to;

1. Define the genetic basis for PPNAD and/or the Carney Complex.
2. Determine the molecular changes associated with the development of the tumors.
3. Identify carriers of the disease.
4. Determine the prognosis for carriers and affected individuals.
5.

Unfortunately, AC treatment is associated with up to 19% risk of heart failure (HF). Current standard of care for preventing AC induced HF (AIHF) is cardiac surveillance followed by initiation of treatment once HF is diagnosed. With this approach 89% of patients fail to recover heart function and 46% will experience adverse cardiac events. Therefore there is a need for effective preventive therapy to reduce the risk of AIHF. Based on small human studies, animal studies, and our own pilot data, statins are an ideal class of drug for this purpose.

We will conduct a pilot double blinded, placebo controlled, randomized controlled trial to assess whether pre-treatment with statins before AC can prevent heart dysfunction.

Elucidating the mechanisms that contribute to adverse cardiovascular outcomes and reduced quality of life among the growing population of childhood cancer survivors is paramount. Cancer, certain cancer drugs, radiation therapy, cancer-associated lifestyle disturbances, and cancer-independent comorbidities combine to predispose cancer survivors to autonomic dysfunction (AD). Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been described in various cancer cohorts. Furthermore, these markers of AD have been implicated in adverse outcomes in oncology patients, including increased mortality, exercise limitation, and fatigue. However, data are largely derived from small studies with methodological limitations, and the contribution of AD to overall morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors is not well understood.

Unfortunately, both the chemotherapy drugs used in this setting (anthracyclines) and trastuzumab are known to cause cardiac dysfunction in a proportion of patients. Patients who develop heart problems when taking trastuzumab might have to stop this treatment, which could jeopardise their chances of cure. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) is a cardiac biomarker that is measured in the blood, the levels of which have been shown to indicate the presence of heart failure. Some early research has suggested that there may be a correlation between elevated NT pro-BNP and heart damage due to cancer chemotherapy and also trastuzumab. Troponin is another substance measured in the blood that can indicate heart damage. Finally, certain variations in an individual's genetic makeup (called polymorphisms) could put them at increased risk of heart damage from trastuzumab. Here we are studying whether any of these factors (NT pro-BNP levels, troponin levels, or certain genetic polymorphisms) can accurately predict who is at highest risk of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity.

The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of NT pro-BNP as a predictive biomarker for the development of trastuzumab related cardiotoxicity (TRC).

NCT02101879,"Cardiotoxicity in Metastatic Her 2 Positive Patients Treated With Trastuzumab ,Pertuzumab and Taxanes",https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02101879,,UNKNOWN,"Approximately 15-25% of all breast cancers are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and it has been well known that HER2 overexpression is associated with more aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis with resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents.

Trastuzumab administration as an adjuvant and in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer is associated with both symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiotoxicity. The incidence of trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity were 27% with antracycline combination and 13% when it was administered with paclitaxel .

Pertuzumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody binding to the HER2 dimerization domain, prevents dimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors (HER3,HER1, and HER4) especially with HER3. Blocking HER2-HER3 dimerization is postulated to be the most clinically relevant action of pertuzumab and this can effectively block her2-mediated cell signaling.

Pertuzumab is indicated in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

Treatment of breast cancer with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel as first line treatment until disease progression might be complicated by cardiotoxicity in up to 14.5% of the Patients.

Cardinale et al showed that troponin I (TNI) positive identifies trastuzumab-treated patients who are at risk for cardiotoxicity and are unlikely to recover from cardiac dysfunction despite HF therapy.

There is very little data about the reversibility and identification of patients at risk for cardiotoxicity of the pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel regimen and of those who will not recover from cardiac dysfunction,this information is crucial. The usefulness of troponin I (TNI) and Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the identification of patients at risk for PT cardiotoxicity and in the prediction of LVEF recovery has never been investigated.

NCT03850171,Cancer Adverse Effects PReventIon With Care & Exercise: the CAPRICE Study,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03850171,,TERMINATED,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Similarly, Hodgkin and non- Hodgkin lymphomas make up two of the most prevalent cancers in men and women. Even though remarkable improvements in cancer-free survival have been achieved in the last decades, the development of cardiac toxicity, associated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Anth-bC) counteracts the improvements in survival in these patient groups. One of the first clinical manifestation of Anth-bC cardiotoxicity is diastolic dysfunction, with further symptoms being left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure as well as a decline in exercise tolerance. Besides the direct cardiotoxic effects of anticancer treatment, many drugs also have adverse effects on the vascular endothelium.

The concept of 'Exercise is Medicine' has become well established in exercise-oncology research. Exercise therapy is now considered a safe and well-tolerated adjunct therapy inducing beneficial effects on body composition, aerobic fitness and muscular strength, pain and fatigue, quality of life (QoL), depressive symptoms, and all cause survival. However, there is insufficient data on the superiority of performing exercise training therapy before and during chemotherapy with regard to cardiotoxic and cardiovascular side effects. Further, there is no data on patient preference for and barriers toward different timings of exercise training therapy.

Therefore, the aim of the study is to compare left ventricular (LV) function measured by LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) in breast cancer and lymphoma patients undergoing Anth-bC randomised to completing an exercise-based rehabilitation programme during chemotherapy to those randomised to complete the programme after chemotherapy. Further, blood samples will be drawn to analyse biomarkers of myocardial injury (brain natriuretic peptide and high-sensitive cardiac troponin).

Additional measurements include aortic distensibility as part of the echocardiographic examination and exercise capacity through cardiopulmonary exercise testing. QoL and fatigue will be assessed in a questionnaire, compliance with exercise training through monitoring and patient preference at 3 and 6 months will be evaluated through an interview. Cardiovascular risk factors will be assessed through body composition, 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 24h electrocardiogram and the analysis of established blood markers.

Women and men aged 18 years and older with histologically confirmed breast cancer or lymphoma (ECOG grade 0-2) who are Anth-bC naïve and with reasonable life expectancy will be included in the study.

The exercise programme is part of onco-rehabilitation programmes at the Inselspital Bern, the Spital AG Thun and the Bürgerspital Solothurn. Programmes last for 12 weeks and offer two supervised sessions per week (@ 60-90 min). They usually contain an endurance component (e.g. 40 min of cycling) and a strength, agility or relaxation component. Patients are encouraged to complete a third exercise session per week at home or elsewhere. Home-based training and general physical activity will be assessed by a questionnaire and an activity monitor.

A total of 120 patients will be recruited. Measurements will be performed at baseline, after 3 months (week 13) and after 6 months (week 26).",NO,Breast Neoplasm Female|Lymphoma|Cardiotoxicity|Anthracyclines|Physical Activity,OTHER: Exercise Training,"Changes from baseline in left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS), GLS assessed by speckle tracking echocardiography is an established marker for LV systolic function with a good reproducibility, which has also been found in the investigators' laboratory.

Cardiac troponin release after high-dose chemotherapy is a marker for chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in cancer patients and identifies patients at different risks of cardiac events in the years thereafter. The increment of hs-TnT has been found to be predictive for cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients at 3 months after initiation of Anth-bC. Both, NT-proBNP and hs-TnT have been recommended as early biomarkers of cardiotoxicity by the European Society of Cardiology in the guidelines on cancer treatments and cardiovascular toxicity., week 0, 13, and 26|Identification of barriers towards exercise training, Barriers toward exercise training therapy will be identified by a self-designed questionnaire., week 13 and 26|Compliance with exercise training, Number of attended center-based sessions will be monitored by the attending physiotherapists. Additional home-based training and general physical activity will be assessed by the GPAQ- questionnaire. It collects information on physical activity participation in three domains (work, transport and recreational activities) as well as sedentary behaviour, comprising 16 questions (P1-P16). Within the work and discretionary domains, questions assess the frequency and duration of activity defined by the energy requirement or intensity (vigorous- or moderate-intensity). In the transport domain, the frequency and duration of all walking and cycling for transport is captured. The main outcome variables from GPAQ analysis include a categorical variable of total physical activity (high, moderate and low) and a continuous variable of total physical activity within each domain (reported as Median METmin/week), which will be used to quantify the volume of weekly physical activity., week 0, 13 and 26|Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), The FACIT-F (version 4.0) is a 41-item compilation of general questions divided into four domains of cancer-specific quality of life (physical well-being ranging from 0-28, social/family well-being ranging from 0-28, emotional well-being ranging from 0-24 and functional well-being ranging from 0-28) and a module for fatigue (13 items, ranging from 0- 52).FACIT-F total score ranges from 0- 160.

For example, some chemotherapy drugs (e.g., anthracyclines) are known to cause declines in heart health. While the impact can vary, some will experience substantial heart damage that may lead to heart failure and death. As these treatments are highly effective, there is a need to find ways to reduce the damaging effects while not interfering with its anticancer potential.

If you have already had clinical genetic testing and meet eligibility criteria for this study as shown in the Eligibility Section, you may enroll regardless of the results of your clinical genetic testing.

While it is well recognized that hereditary factors contribute to the development of a subset of human cancers, the cause for many cancers remains unknown. The application of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has expanded knowledge in the field of hereditary cancer predisposition. Currently, more than 100 cancer predisposing genes have been identified, and it is now estimated that approximately 10% of all cancer patients have an underlying genetic predisposition.

The purpose of this protocol is to identify novel cancer predisposing genes and/or genetic variants. For this study, the investigators will establish a Data Registry linked to a Repository of biological samples. Health information, blood samples and occasionally leftover tumor samples will be collected from individuals with familial cancer. The investigators will use NGS approaches to find changes in genes that may be important in the development of familial cancer. The information gained from this study may provide new and better ways to diagnose and care for people with hereditary cancer.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

* Establish a registry of families with clustering of cancer in which clinical data are linked to a repository of cryopreserved blood cells, germline DNA, and tumor tissues from the proband and other family members.

NCT05703126,Clinical and Diagnostic Significance of Endothelial Dysfunction and Myocardial Contractility in Patients With AML,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05703126,,RECRUITING,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal neoplastic disease of the hematopoietic tissue associated with a mutation in the precursor cell of hematopoiesis, which results in a differentiation block and uncontrolled proliferation of immature myeloid cells.

Anthracycline antibiotics have been an integral part of the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia since the 1970s. However, the clinical usefulness of anthracyclines is limited primarily by the high incidence of cardiotoxicity. According to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for cardio-oncology, cardiovascular toxicity is defined as any impairment of cardiac function associated with anticancer treatment, as the term encompasses both a wide range of possible clinical manifestations and an etiological relationship with various treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and treatment with targeted drugs. Cardiovascular toxicity can be acute, subacute or delayed, manifesting many years after chemotherapy or radiation therapy, involving a number of cardiac structures, which can lead to the development of heart failure, coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, including cardiac conduction disorders and diseases of the pericardium.

Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is the negative effect of anthracyclines on normal cardiac activity due to their toxic effects on the heart muscle and the cardiac conduction system. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity manifests as asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in 57% of treated patients and restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy leading to congestive heart failure (CHF) in 16% to 20% of patients. Anthracycline-induced congestive heart failure is often resistant to therapy and has a mortality rate of up to 79%. Thus, there is a need for early detection of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with chemotherapy treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in order to timely prescribe drug therapy.

Purpose of the study To optimize the early detection of endothelial dysfunction and left ventricular myocardial contractility in patients with acute myeloid leukemia during chemotherapy treatment based on a comprehensive assessment of instrumental and laboratory research parameters.

Expected results Based on a comprehensive analysis using laser Doppler flowmetry, stress echocardiography with the determination of global longitudinal strain of the myocardium, biochemical markers of endothelial damage and cardiac biomarkers, a correlation between violations of the contractility of the left ventricular myocardium and violations of the vasoregulatory function of the vascular endothelium will be revealed, which will allow developing an algorithm for early detection of cardiomyopathy and vascular complications in patients with acute myeloid leukemia during chemotherapy treatment.",NO,"Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Adult|Cardiotoxicity|Endothelial Dysfunction","DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: History taking|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Anthropometry|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Complete blood count|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Biochemical blood test|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Coagulogram|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Immunoenzymatic analysis of the level of endothelin-1, asymmetric dimethylarginine|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Stress echocardiography with the definition of global longitudinal deformation of the myocardium|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Triplex scanning of neck vessels|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Electrocardiography|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Ultrasound of the abdominal cavity (with calculation of the area of the spleen) and lymph nodes|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Cytogenetic examination of the bone marrow to determine genetic abnormalities.|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Cytological examination of bone marrow cells with cytochemical examination|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Immunophenotypic examination of the bone marrow by flow cytometry|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Determination of the presence of a FLT3 mutation using the PCR Method|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: laser Doppler flowmetry","Change of global longitudinal strain of 15% or more relative to the initial values, Change of global longitudinal strain of the myocardium according to stress echocardiography by 15% or more relative to the values obtained before the start of chemotherapy treatment., Evaluation is carried out within 1 week after each course of chemotherapy up to 10 months, evaluated after each course of induction of remission and consolidation of remission.","Change of the index of microcirculation according to laser Doppler flowmetry, Change of the microcirculation index according to the results of laser Doppler flowmetry in relation to the values obtained before the start of chemotherapy treatment., Evaluation is carried out within 1 week after each course of chemotherapy up to 10 months, evaluated after each course of induction of remission and consolidation of remission.|Change of the Coefficient of Variation of Microcirculation According to Laser Doppler Fluometry, Change of the coefficient of variation of microcirculation according to the results of laser Doppler flowmetry in relation to the values obtained before the start of chemotherapy treatment., Evaluation is carried out within 1 week after each course of chemotherapy up to 10 months, evaluated after each course of induction of remission and consolidation of remission.|Change of the level of highly sensitive T-troponin, Change of the level of highly sensitive T-troponin, which goes beyond the reference values, in relation to the values obtained before the start of chemotherapy treatment., Evaluation is carried out within 1 week after each course of chemotherapy up to 10 months, evaluated after each course of induction of remission and consolidation of remission.|Change of brain natriuretic peptide level, Change of the level of brain natriuretic peptide that goes beyond the reference values, in relation to the values obtained before the start of chemotherapy treatment., Evaluation is carried out within 1 week after each course of chemotherapy up to 10 months, evaluated after each course of induction of remission and consolidation of remission.|Change of the level of asymmetric dimethylarginine, Change of the level of asymmetric dimethylarginine that goes beyond the reference values, in relation to the values obtained before the start of chemotherapy treatment., Evaluation is carried out within 1 week after each course of chemotherapy up to 10 months, evaluated after each course of induction of remission and consolidation of remission.|Change of the level of endothelin-1, Change of the level of endothelin-1, which goes beyond the reference values, in relation to the values obtained before the start of chemotherapy treatment., Evaluation is carried out within 1 week after each course of chemotherapy up to 10 months, evaluated after each course of induction of remission and consolidation of remission.",,Samara State Medical University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,100,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,77880421319552,2022-12-01,2025-01-01,2025-08-03,2023-01-27,,2023-01-27,"Clinics of the Samara Medical University, Samara, Samara Region, 443079, Russian Federation",

NCT02232126,Social Work Intervention Focused on Transitions,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02232126,SWIFT,COMPLETED,"In response to Program Announcement (PA)-09-164, ""NIH Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Program (R21) a randomized pilot study testing the efficacy of SWIFT: Social Work Intervention Focused on Transitions among at-risk older adults following hospital discharge to home. This study is drawn from several observations. First, transitions between care settings create elevated risk for poor outcomes and for readmission among older adults leaving the hospital for home largely due to fragmented care and poor communication. Next, while few studies exist that test methods to improve transitions, those available are largely medically focused, using a nurse or advanced practice nurse in their approach. Although evidence exists to support the effectiveness of these models, few have been replicated and none have been integrated into standard health care practice. This may be attributed to several factors including the availability of the needed staff, the lack of existing structures to support these roles, and the costs of implementing these interventions. Finally, a social work driven intervention may provide a replicable mechanism for bridging medical care, addressing psychosocial needs as well as medical needs, and improving linkages with community services while reducing care duplication. This study aimed to test a structured social work transition intervention model to reduce rates of hospital readmission and medical service use while improving patient satisfaction with the care transition process. A randomized pilot study was used to test a social work transitions model designed to improve care provided to frail older adults being discharged from the hospital to return to the community. Eligible patients consenting to participate (n=181) were randomly assigned to either the social work transitions model intervention or usual care. This project was conducted at Huntington Hospital, a 525-bed, nonprofit, community hospital located in Pasadena, California. In an average year, Huntington Hospital has approximately 10,000 older adults discharged from their facility, 44% of who are 80 years old or older. Those randomized to the intervention arm received up to six sessions from the social worker, at least one provided in the home. The social work intervention was designed to overcome common problems following hospital discharge including medication review, discussion and planning around discharge instruction, assistance in scheduling follow up appointments, assessments of psychosocial and other support service needs and provision of linkages to address those needs. Outcomes were measured three and six months following arrival at home, with an interim measure of satisfaction at 10 days following arrival at home, with measures including patient level of depression, pain, physical functioning, self-efficacy with disease management, and medical service use.",YES,Study Focus: 30-day Rehospitalizations Among At-risk Older Adults Randomized to a Social Work-driven Care Transitions Intervention|Heart Disease|Diabetes|Hypertension|Cancer|Depression|Asthma|Chronic Heart Failure|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease|Stroke,OTHER: SWIFT home intervention,"30-day Hospital Readmission, The outcome measure is the number of readmissions experienced by participants in the Usual Care and Intervention groups within 30-days of their index discharge., 30-days post hospitalization","30-day Readmission Among Intervention Participants, The outcome measure is the rate of 30-day readmissions among Intervention group participants that declined to receive the in-home social work intervention versus those Intervention group participants that received the in-home social work intervention., 30-days",,University of Southern California,Huntington Hospital|National Institute on Aging (NIA),ALL,OLDER_ADULT,NA,181,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH",UP-10-00372|5R21AG034557-02,2011-02,2013-10,2013-10,2014-09-05,2014-12-04,2017-02-10,"University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, 90089, United States|Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, California, 91105, United States",
NCT03969693,Lymphoma Patients Undergoing Mediastinal Radiotherapy in the Era of Modern Chemoradiation,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03969693,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Malignant anterior mediastinal tumors essentially include lymphomas and thymomas. The location of mediastinum is anatomically close to several critical organs such as heart, lung, and breasts, which might be affected meaningfully when the mediastinal region is irradiated. There have been quite a few studies investigating long-term toxicities concerning the above critical organs and risks of secondary malignancies related to treatment regimens combining chemotherapy and mediastinal radiotherapy. With the advancement of modern radiotherapy, highly conformal and intensity modulated radiotherapy have become a radiotherapeutic standard in recent years. However, most previous studies analyzed patients treated in the era of 2D techniques rather than conformal 3D plans. Almost inevitably, a large volume of the heart and lung was irradiated via the 2D technique with which substantial dose levels might be given to these organs unavoidably. Certainly long-term radiotherapy related toxicities are significantly associated with the dose and volume irradiating the normal organs at risk. Relying on the techniques of modern conformal radiotherapy and the contemporary strategy of multimodality therapy, the dose and volume irradiating the heart and lung were considerably reduced. Therefore, objective tools including heart echocardiography and lung function test will be utilized in this prospective study to evaluate and monitor mainly the patients diagnosed as malignant lymphoma who are recommended to receive mediastinal radiotherapy in the era of modern treatment strategy and techniques.

The participants potentially included in the current study are mainly lymphoma patients with mediastinal malignant lymphoma or patients whose radiation therapy field essentially encompasses anterior mediastinum. Patients are prospectively enrolled in this study after physicians' clinical judgement. After signing the consent form, the recruited patient will receive comprehensive pre-radiotherapy evaluations, including cardiac echocardiography, laboratory tests (BNP, and NT-pro BNP), and lung function tests. Participants who are particularly female patients under the age of 45 will receive pre-radiotherapy breast echocardiography. Radiotherapy treatment planning of both photon and proton respectively will be simulated on Eclipse® treatment planning system. Subsequently participants will receive mediastinal RT within one month after being enrolled in the study. Eligible patients should receive standard multidisciplinary treatment as the tumor board at our institute has suggested. Modern radiotherapy techniques comprise all available modalities in our hospital, including photon or proton beams, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, volumetric modulated arc therapy, image-guidance, and breathing control system. The prescription of treatment field designing and dose scheme will comply with our institutional protocols and updated cancer treatment guidelines. Participants will receive longitudinal follow-up examinations at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36 months after the start of RT course. Standardized examinations include the above mentioned cardiac echocardiography and relevant tests.

It is anticipated that long-term mediastinal RT-related late effects are prospectively and longitudinally surveyed through consistent heart examinations and lung function tests. Long-term effects are expected to be lower with using maturely and widely adopted modern RT techniques. Therapeutic and survival outcomes are expected to be satisfactory, achieving the international level in this prospective observational study focusing on mainly lymphoma patients with mediastinal involvement who are suggested and scheduled to receive mediastinal RT as part of the combined modality treatment.

This study aims to standardize the application of clinical examinations including cardiac echocardiography, lung function tests, and relevant laboratory tests as part of objective tools for monitoring patients' cardiac and pulmonary functions after receiving mediastinal RT. Therefore, it is expected that the risk factors of predisposing patients to develop cardiac toxicities after chemoradiation particularly including mediastinal RT will be explored and identified. In addition objectivity of BNP (or NT-pro BNP) will also be verified in combination with the objective measurement and findings obtained from cardiac echocardiography.

NCT01904903,Cardiac Safety Study in Patients With HER2 + Breast Cancer,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01904903,SAFE-HEaRt,COMPLETED,"HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.

Unfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.

In this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed ""picture"" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.

Particularly, the study will assess the use of strategies for dose reduction during CCTA.

A decade ago, the multicentre observational PROTECTION-I study has revealed that the dose-length-product of CCTA ranges between 568 - 1259 mGy x cm with a median of 885 mGy x cm. This corresponds to an estimated effective dose of approximately 12 mSv. Since then a variety of techniques have been developed and enhanced in order to reduce radiation exposure during CCTA. Recent studies demonstrated feasibility of dramatically reduced effective radiation doses during CCTA (0,1 - 0,3 mSv). This has been executed in small cohorts of patients at scientific expert centers. However, it remains unclear, if such low-level radiation dose exposure may be achieved in clinical routine and if diagnostic image quality is maintained. In order to analyze the magnitude of radiation dose exposure of CCTA in today's clinical practice and the current use of dose-saving techniques, we designed the PROTECTION-VI study.

This study focuses on diseases that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the UK, and specifically examines the extent and basis of treatment failure in different patient populations.

The vast majority of drug registration clinical trials have under-representation of ethnic minority populations. In addition, the wider Caucasian populations have reasonably different clinical characteristics to the population that participated in the drug licencing clinical trials. A consequence of this is that drugs are licensed for use in real-world general patient populations where the clinical trial results are simply not statistically significant to specifically demonstrate efficacy or safety in populations that were either absent or under-represented in the drug registration clinical trials. When these facts are considered alongside data that supports significant under-reporting of adverse events in the real-world setting within the UK (and globally, e.g the USA and Europe), it highlights that pharmacovigilance systems are unable to capture drug effectiveness and safety data in a manner that can reasonably assure appropriate prescribing in the wider patient populations.

This large real-world research study aims to identify whether commonly prescribed drugs are effective in treating illnesses that cause significant poor health and death in the different patient populations that represent the UK.

NCT04663685,MoveStrong at Home,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04663685,,UNKNOWN,"Sufficient muscle strength helps to get out of a chair and can prevent falls. Up to 30% of older adults experience age-related loss of muscle strength, which can lead to frailty and health instability. Exercise helps to build muscle, maintain bone density and prevent chronic disease, especially during the aging process. In older adults at risk of mobility impairment, exercise greatly reduced incidence and effects did not vary by frailty status. However, more than 75% of Canadian adults ≥18 years of age are not meeting physical activity guidelines. In addition, it is known that malnutrition, including low protein intake, may lead to poor physical function. While there are services to support exercise and nutrition, barriers to implementing them persist. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the potential for physical inactivity, malnutrition, and loneliness among older adults, especially those with pre-existing health or mobility impairments. Now and in future, alternate ways to promote exercise and proper nutrition to the most vulnerable are needed. The investigators propose to adapt MoveStrong, an 8-week education program combining functional and balance training with strategies to increase protein intake. The program was co-developed with patient advocates, Osteoporosis Canada, the YMCA, Community Support Connections and others. MoveStrong will be delivered by telephone or web conference to older adults in their homes, using mailed program instructions, 1-on-1 training sessions through Physitrack®, as well as online nutrition seminars and support groups over Microsoft® Teams.

One patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma.However, protein F cannot be detected by serum protein electrophoresis. Preliminary studies have shown that this novel protein F have an obvious absorption peak at about 600nm. Placed at 2-8 degrees for 7 days, protein F will be isolated from heparin plasma. To the naked eye, protein F appear to be transparent jelly between the red blood cells and the plasma. The specific protein F, how it is produced, how it causes disease are still unknown.

Exercise is a cornerstone of CVD prevention and treatment; yet, exercise has not been adopted as a standard of care in AYA-CS at high CVD risk. The HIMALAYAS trial is designed to evaluate the impact of an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program on cardiovascular (CV) and psychosocial health, as well as CVD risk, in AYA-CS with mild heart dysfunction (stage B heart failure (SBHF)). The primary objective of the HIMALAYAS study is to determine whether supervised Cardio-oncology Rehabilitation \[CORE; Group 1A\], consisting of moderate to high-intensity aerobic exercise training, CVD risk factor modification and enhanced online behavioural support, improves cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak; primary outcome), cardiac function, CVD risk factors and biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at 6, 12, and 24 months compared to standard of care \[CON1; Group 1B\] in AYA-CS with SBHF. Additionally, AYA-CS with and without SBHF will participate in a secondary randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the independent effects of two passive behavioural support strategies based on the attainment of the personal activity intelligence (PAI) score \[PAI; Group 2A\] or the exercise guidelines for cancer survivors \[ExGL; Group 2B\] on cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiac function,

NCT02784587,Feasibility of Perioperative Stellate Ganglion Blocks in Cardiac Surgery,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02784587,,COMPLETED,"Based upon Northern New England Cardiovascular Study Group data, the rate of post operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) requiring treatment following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at Maine Medical Center (MMC) is currently 30%. Nationally, POAF occurs in up to 40% of patients post CABG, 50% of patients after valve surgery, 64% of patients post mitral valve and CABG and 49% after aortic valve replacement. Atrial fibrillation worsens a patient's hemodynamic status and increases the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF), embolic events and longer ICU stays leading to increased patient morbidity and strain on financial resources. In the U.S., POAF carries a higher risk of stroke (37% OR 2.0 in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.7), worsened survival (74% versus 87%), and an additional 4.9 days and $10,000-$11,500 in hospital stay costs.

Atrial fibrillation requires both an initiation trigger and favorable environment for maintenance and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems play important roles in this regard. Unfortunately, the precise mechanisms of POAF are still being investigated. This postoperative complication has persisted in spite of efforts to mitigate it pharmacologically with beta blockers and amiodarone, an experience shared by most other cardiac surgery centers.

The stellate ganglion is formed by the fusion of the inferior cervical sympathetic ganglion and first thoracic sympathetic ganglion. By modulating the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system, stellate ganglion stimulation has been shown to facilitate induction of atrial fibrillation while ablation may reduce or prevent episodes. Human studies have further supported this model.

Preliminary studies of perioperative stellate ganglion block (SGB) in cardiac surgery suggest that this technique may reduce or prevent episodes of POAF requiring treatment. The investigator's ultimate goal is to determine whether SGB reduces the incidence of POAF in specific cardiac surgery populations at MMC. First, however, the investigator proposes to test the hypothesis that SGB, performed perioperatively by cardiac anesthesiologists in a population of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, is both safe and clinically feasible.",YES,Atrial Fibrillation,PROCEDURE: Stellate Ganglion Block,"Success of Stellate Ganglion Block, Correct placement of stellate ganglion block as measured by a temperature rise of at least 1 degree Celsius in the ipsilateral hand, day of surgery","Rate of Atrial Fibrillation, The current rate of atrial fibrillation is measured by the Northern New England Cardiac Database, this existing database will track a-fib rates until the patients are discharged from the hospital after surgery., Through study completion, approximately 1 year",,"Christopher Connors, MD",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,25,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,"#4624",2016-05-31,2016-12-06,2016-12-07,2016-05-27,2019-04-22,2019-07-08,,

The 1st peroperative phase of ""hepatic resection"" requires a minimum supply of filling fluids to limit perioperative bleeding (Low Central Venous Pressure). However this strategy exposes the risk of organ hypoperfusion due to low cardiac flow, secondary to hypovolaemia, which may lead to ischemic situations favoring the onset of postoperative complications. On the other hand, the hemodynamic management of the 2nd peroperative phase ""post hepatic resection"" is marked by the need to correct this hypoperfusion by optimizing cardiac output by suitable vascular filling.

The major challenge is thus to restore cardiac output by refilling without excess, by correcting the hypovolemia that arose during the ""post resection of the hepatic parenchyma"" phase.

T2DM is currently the 6th leading cause of mortality in the United States and is a major cause of kidney failure, blindness, amputations, heart attack, and other vascular and gastro-intestinal dysfunctions. Traditionally, treatments include intensive lifestyle modifications with or without glucose lowering agents. Neither treatment alone, or in combination, results in complete resolution of diabetes and its potential long-term complications. Bariatric surgery has been proven as an effective treatment to accomplish sustained and significant weight loss for those with severe obesity and has been shown to induce long-term remission of T2DM. However, despite enthusiasm for these potential treatment options, it is not clear whether diabetes is influenced by the type of surgery or by the amount of weight lost or if bariatric surgery is more effective than non-surgical weight loss induced by diet and physical activity in T2DM patients with moderate BMIs (30-40kg/m2; Class I and Class II obesity, or approximately 65-95 pounds overweight depending on your height).

However, very few patients receive adequate stress relief support prior to a surgical procedure. Provision of education and information about the surgery can be a crucial component of the preoperative experience and is inversely related to levels of preoperative anxiety. However, resource constraints make face-to-face education sessions untenable, given cost considerations and time investment by trained health personnel. Interventions based on mobile health (mHealth) technologies, geared towards increasing familiarity with surgical procedures and hospital environments have been shown to help patients feel informed about possible benefits and risks of available treatment options. mHealth apps and Virtual Reality (VR) can offer patients experience in the perioperative environment that can be helpful in empowering patients and enhancing a more positive experience, while reducing stress. However, available applications focus only on providing informative content, neglecting the importance of patient empowerment with a more robust educational curriculum.

According to this, the Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) CARINAE, aims to support patients and caregivers during the whole perioperative process.

Each part of the study will consist of screening (14 days prior to the start of the study treatment), treatment and follow-up period (14 days).

In Part 1 in Cohort 1 six subjects will receive GSK2118436 225 mg twice a day (BID) on study days 1 to 7 and a single 225 milligram (mg) dose on morning of Day 8. Based on the safety data of subjects in Cohort 1 subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 2 and the dose of GSK2118436 will be escalated to 300 mg BID. If the 225 mg dose of GSK2118436 is not well tolerated in Cohort 1 (i.e., 2 or more dose-limiting toxicities \[DLTs\]), then Cohort 2 of Part 1 will not be initiated and a dose of 150 mg BID of GSK2118436 will be administered in Part 2 of the study. In Cohort 2 six subjects will receive GSK2118436 300 mg BID on Study Days 1 to 7 and a single 300 mg dose on the morning of Day 8. Based on the safety data of subjects in Cohort 2 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. If the 300 mg BID dose level of GSK2118436 is not well tolerated, then the highest tolerated dose will be selected for Part 2 of the study.

In Part 1 of the study the decision to proceed to the next cohort or Part 2 of the study will be based on the safety data of at least 6 evaluable subjects (\<=1 DLTs during the 14 days following the first dose of GSK2118436).

In Part 2 of the study eligible subjects will receive a single dose of GSK2118436/placebo (4 capsules of 75 mg/highest tolerated dose) orally on the first 2 days of the study followed by 2 doses daily for 6 days and a single dose on the 9th day. There will be 1 day when a placebo will be given.

NCT02471885,Effect of Remote Ischaemic Conditioning in Oncology Patients,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02471885,ERIC-ONC,UNKNOWN,"Cancer survival has improved steadily due to earlier detection and treatment. Despite the established efficacy of anthracycline chemotherapy, its damaging effects on the heart (cardiotoxicity) limits treatment and confers acute and long term adverse cardiovascular consequences. Protective strategies for the heart (cardioprotection) with iron binders (chelation), heart rate (beta blockade) and blood pressure (renin angiotensin inhibition) medications have demonstrated promise in adult cancer patients, but these treatments are typically prescribed only after significant changes in heart chamber size and pumping ability are detected by imaging investigations (myocardial dysfunction).

Furthermore, these conventional therapies are constrained by important side effects that affect bone marrow, blood pressure, and the kidneys.

Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) protects the heart by activating cell survival pathways through brief repeated inflations and deflations of a blood pressure cuff to limit blood flow temporarily (noninjurious ischaemia). These innate survival mechanisms prevent part of the cellular injury that occurs during the ischaemia reperfusion cascade during a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Ischaemia reperfusion injury also shares common biochemical pathways with anthracycline cardiotoxicity, and thus RIC may be a novel form of nonpharmacological cardioprotection that can be applied when undergoing anthracycline chemotherapy.

The investigators propose a pilot single centre randomised controlled trial to investigate the effect of RIC on reducing heart muscle damage (myocardial injury) in anthracycline-treated cancer patients.

Major improvements in cancer treatment mean that many people are now living longer with cancer. But certain cancer drugs have the potential to damage the heart and blood vessels. One type of cancer therapy called fluoropyrimidines, is used in many cancers including bowel, breast, pancreatic and head and neck. This chemotherapy can cause chest pain, heart attacks and abnormal heart rhythms in approximately 10% of patients.

Adverse cardiac events lead to disruption of chemotherapy and can lead to adverse cancer outcomes. Some patients will require alternative treatment. Most cardiac events occur during the early cycles of treatment with fluoropyrimidines.

Currently, we do not know how to predict which patients are most likely to be affected. Patients deemed to be at a high cardiovascular risk are often denied this treatment which is first line for all gastrointestinal cancers. There is no hard evidence to support this approach and patients may be inappropriately denied treatment.

If we were able to confidently identify patients at the highest risk, then we could potentially reduce risk of toxicity by giving cardioprotective medications or we would be able to confidently identify those who should be given alternative chemotherapy.

To help children cope with their problems and prevent psychological distress, the investigators developed SiSom, a support system to help children with cancer or CHD report their symptoms and problems in an age-adjusted manner on a touch-pad, portable computer.

This quasi-experimental study with 202 children age 7-12 with CHD or cancer will test the following hypotheses: When children use SiSom to report their symptoms and problems, and this information is provided to their clinicians in their outpatient consultations:

* Children and parents will experience less anxiety.
* Children and parents will be more satisfied with the outpatient visit.
* There will be greater congruence between children's reported symptoms and problems and those addressed by their clinicians as evidenced in documented patient care.

To better understand the mechanisms by which these effects may occur, the investigators will also explore:

* Differences between control and experimental groups in patient-provider communication in terms of instrumental and affective behaviour, participation, initiative and person addressed;
* The relationships among outcomes of patient-provider communication, congruence between patients' reported symptoms and those addressed by their clinicians and children's and parents' anxiety and satisfaction; and how these relationships differ between treatment and control conditions.

Finally, the investigators will investigate time requirements, ease of use and usefulness of SiSom by children and clinicians.

Symptoms such as palpitations (fast, strong or irregular heart beat) and blackouts are common in people with cardiac amyloidosis, but there is not enough information on what causes this. At present, there is also not enough information on when they occur, how often they happen, and which patients are at risk of having serious, life-threatening types of abnormal heart rhythms.

Some of these abnormal heart rhythms can be treated with medicine; others need electronic devices (e.g. pacemakers) implanted or inserted in the heart to prevent serious harm. The information on when is the best time to implant these life-saving devices remains limited. In this study, a small device known as an implantable loop recorder (ILR) will be implanted under the skin on the chest wall to continuously monitor participants' heart rhythm.

This will help us answer some of the questions about what causes the abnormal heart rhythms, when they happen, and which patients are particularly likely to have them. Furthermore, it may help us to identify earlier, rather than later, those who are at risk of developing abnormal heart rhythms. This may lead to improvements in the care of people with cardiac amyloidosis in the future.

In 2016, they were responsible for approximately 211,343 (16%) deaths, followed by cardiovascular diseases (12.6%). Despite the high mortality rate of neoplasia, oncological treatment have advanced substantially in recent decades improving the prognosis of patients. However, growing evidence suggest that some oncological agents may induce significant toxicity that may play a major role in the quality of life, morbidity and mortality. The cardiovascular system is often negatively affected with cancer therapy, predisposing several patients to stop appropriate treatments or to have cardiovascular events related to the cardiotoxicity. The most typical manifestation of cardiotoxicity and related consequences (heart failure) are related to the use of anthracyclines. Anthracyclines are part of the chemotherapy regimen for solid tumors and hematological neoplasms in children and adults, and are associated with an increase in life expectancy. Carvedilol is an α and β-blocker that also has antioxidant properties. Preliminary studies have shown that carvedilol and its metabolites prevent lipid peroxidation, inhibit the formation and inactivate free radicals, in addition to preventing the depletion of endogenous antioxidants, such as vitamin E.

Clinical benefit has been shown for the treatment with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristin and prednisolone (CHOP regimen); this could be further improved recently by the addition of rituximab (R-CHOP), a monoclonal antibody.

Improved response and overall survival rates make it necessary to evaluate late toxicities of the therapy regimens. Cardiotoxicity is a known risk factor of specific chemotherapies, with 7% patients being affected if doxorubicin cumulative doses are under 550mg/sqm.

This leads to frequent critical situations for patients and high risk surgical interventions. The majority of patients and their practitioners are not prepared for the consequences of a complex and possibly fatal course.

Palliative medicine makes it possible to anticipate the further course of the disease. As a result, palliative medicine has become increasingly important. The beginning of palliative medical interventions has extended from accompaniment limited to the dying phase to earlier phases of the disease.

An early integration of palliative medicine showed a positive effect on the quality of life, the degree of depression and survival in patients suffering from cancer, for example. Furthermore, patients were more able to accept a change in therapy goal at the end of life. Similar results were shown for patients with a non-malignant severe disease such as COPD or heart failure.

What needs further investigating is how to adequately screen and identify the patient populations who could benefit from early palliative care, so that they are prepared for potentially critical and life-threatening situations.

NCT03934905,Protective Effects of the Nutritional Supplement Sulforaphane on Doxorubicin-Associated Cardiac Dysfunction,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03934905,,RECRUITING,"Cardiomyopathy is a major complication of doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy, and 10-21% of breast cancer patients receiving DOX experience compromised cardiac function. Recent advancements have increased cancer survivorship but it remains clinically challenging to mitigate the cardiotoxic side effects. Although there are several strategies used to reduce the occurrence and severity of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, they are not particularly effective. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop new strategies that prevent the cardiotoxic effects of DOX but maintain its potency as a cancer therapy. Because the cellular events responsible for the antitumor activity of DOX and DOX-induced cardiotoxicity are distinctly different, it may be possible to develop therapies that selectively mitigate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Thus, the investigators propose to test an adjuvant therapy that combines the phytochemical sulforaphane (SFN) with DOX to attenuate DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. SFN activates the transcription factor Nrf2 and induces defense mechanisms in normal cells. Furthermore, SFN inhibits carcinogenesis and metastases and enhances cancer cell sensitivity to DOX, seemingly through Nrf2-independent mechanisms. SFN has also been tested in several clinical trials, although never together with DOX. Our early animal studies suggest that by activating Nrf2, SFN selectively protects the mouse and rat from DOX cardiotoxicity, enhances survival and enhances the effects of DOX on cancer growth in a rat breast cancer model. The investigators suspect that SFN affects DOX metabolism in cancer cells to enhance tumor regression, or it may synergistically activate other key antitumor mechanisms. Hence, SFN may improve the clinical outcome of cancer therapy by (1) attenuating DOX cardiotoxicity and (2) enhancing the effects of cancer treatment on the tumor. Our hypothesis is that SFN protects the heart from DOX-mediated cardiac injury without altering the antitumor efficacy of DOX. In Aim 1, the investigators will conduct an early-phase clinical trial to determine if SFN is safe to administer to breast cancer patients undergoing DOX chemotherapy. In Aim 2, the investigators will determine if SFN decreases DOX-induced inflammatory responses and enhances Nrf2- and SIRT1-target gene expression in breast cancer patients. Notably, transcript and protein signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can predict cardiac function in patients undergoing DOX chemotherapy for breast cancer. The investigators will also determine if SFN/DOX treatment activates Nrf2- and SIRT1-dependent gene expression, alters the levels of biomarkers for presymptomatic DOX-cardiotoxicity and mitigates the generation of cardiotoxic metabolites in PBMCs and plasma. These studies will facilitate the development of SFN co-treatment as a strategy to enhance the efficacy and safety of DOX cancer therapy.",NO,Anthracycline Related Cardiotoxicity in Breast Cancer,DRUG: sulforaphane|DRUG: Placebo Oral Tablet,"Change in cardiac function after DOX therapy with or without sulforaphane through diagnostic studies, 2D Echo will be used to measure cardiac function amongst patients on DOX therapy who are exposed to sulforaphane or placebo., At baseline and 1 year from baseline assessment.","Elevation of troponin levels as a surrogate evidence of DOX related cardiotoxicity will be checked at baseline, prior to each DOX therapy and then at 1 year from baseline assessment (Each cycle is 14 days)., Troponin will be used to assess for cardiotoxicity amongst patients on DOX therapy who are exposed to sulforaphane or placebo., At baseline, prior to each cycle of DOX, at completion of 4th cycle of DOX therapy and 1 year from baseline assessment.|Tumor size in patients on DOX therapy with or without sulforaphane treatment will be assessed at baseline, at completion of DOX chemotherapy (4 cycles planned with each cycle being 14 days) and at 1 year from baseline assessment., We will use PET imaging for comparison of change in tumor size for patients on DOX therapy with or without sulforaphane., 2 days before first DOX treatment, 2 days after completion of 4th cycle of DOX therapy and 1 year from first DOX treatment",,Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,70,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION",L19-065,2022-06-01,2025-11-01,2026-06-01,2019-05-02,,2022-07-19,"Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, 79430, United States",Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan|Informed Consent Form

A number of clinical studies are planned for, covering different parts of paediatric healthcare. The concept of child-centred care is essential. Experienced researchers from care science, medicine, economics, technology, and social science will collaborate around common issues. Expertise on IT technology will analyse the preconditions for using IT; economic evaluations will be performed alongside clinical studies; and cultural and implementation perspectives will be used to analyse the challenges that arise from the changes in relations among children, family and professionals, which may occur as a result of the introduction of eHealth.

Child health is not only important in itself. Investments in child health may also generate significant future gains, such as improved educational and labour market performance. Six complex, long-term and costly challenges in paediatric healthcare are planned for, involving eHealth technology such as interactive video consultation, pictures, on-line monitoring, and textual communication. The research follows an international framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions in healthcare. End-users (families) and relevant care providers (professionals in health and social care) will participate throughout the research process.

NCT00460616,Cardiac Valve Complications in Prolactinomas Treated With Cabergoline,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00460616,ValveCab,COMPLETED,"Dopamine agonists are first-line agents for the treatment of prolactinomas (1) and Parkinson's disease (2). There is evidence supporting a causal relationship between the occurrence of drug-induced ""restrictive"" valvular heart disease and treatment with pergolide (3): in several cases, the valvulopathy improved when pergolide was discontinued (4). Valvular heart damage has also been reported with the ergot-derived dopamine agonists bromocriptine and cabergoline (5,6).

Two recent studies (7,8) have further demonstrated that both pergolide and cabergoline are associated with an increased risk of new cardiac valve regurgitation in patients treated for Parkinson's disease.

The valvular abnormalities seen with ergot-derived dopamine agonists are similar to those observed in patients receiving ergot alkaloid agents (such as ergotamine and methysergide) in the treatment of migraine, or fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine in the treatment of obesity. These abnormalities also closely resemble carcinoid-related valvulopathies (9).

Cardiac valve disease has never been reported in patients with prolactinomas who require treatment with dopamine-agonists even life-long (1). At variance with patients with Parkinson's disease, patients with prolactinomas are younger and are treated with an average dose of dopamine-agonists that is significantly lower (median bromocriptine dose 5 mg/day and median cabergoline dose 1 mg/week). Because of the young age of treatment beginning (most patients with microprolactinomas start dopamine-agonist treatment in early adulthood), treatment might be continued for over 3 decades: the cumulative risk of low doses of dopamine agonists for such a long period of treatment is currently unknown.

To assess the prevalence of cardiac valve disease in patients treated with cabergoline, we wish to perform an echocardiography screening in a large representative sample of patients with prolactinoma who were treated with cabergoline for at least 12 months and in a group of control subjects recruited prospectively. We wish to evaluate the severity of regurgitation for the mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves.

NCT04463316,GROWing Up With Rare GENEtic Syndromes,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04463316,GROW UR GENES,RECRUITING,"Introduction Rare complex syndromes Patients with complex genetic syndromes, by definition, have combined medical problems affecting multiple organ systems, and intellectual disability is often part of the syndrome. During childhood, patients with rare genetic syndromes receive multidisciplinary and specialized medical care; they usually receive medical care from 3-4 medical specialists.

Increased life expectancy Although many genetic syndromes used to cause premature death, improvement of medical care has improved life expectancy. More and more patients are now reaching adult age, and the complexity of the syndrome persists into adulthood. However, until recently, multidisciplinary care was not available for adults with rare genetic syndromes. Ideally, active and well-coordinated health management is provided to prevent, detect, and treat comorbidities that are part of the syndrome. However, after transition from pediatric to adult medical care, patients and their parents often report fragmented poor quality care instead of adequate and integrated health management. Therefore, pediatricians express the urgent need for adequate, multidisciplinary adult follow up of their pediatric patients with rare genetic syndromes.

Medical guidelines for adults not exist and the literature on health problems in these adults is scarce. Although there is a clear explanation for the absence of adult guidelines (i.e. the fact that in the past patients with rare genetic syndromes often died before reaching adult age), there is an urgent need for an overview of medical issues at adult age, for 'best practice' and, if possible, for medical guidelines.

The aim of this study is to get an overview of medical needs of adults with rare genetic syndromes, including:

1. comorbidities
2. medical and their impact on quality of life
3. medication use
4. the need for adaption of medication dose according to each syndrome

""Investigational"" means that the imaging technique is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it- such as whether the technique can detect lower levels of cardiac injury after treatment with doxorubicin. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved the use of gadolinium or approved the use of CMR studies for detection of cardiac toxicity after doxorubicin.

The chemotherapy drug that you have been scheduled to be treated with, doxorubicin, has been associated with the development of heart failure in some patients. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is a type of MRI scan that uses a magnetic field to produce pictures of the heart. The CMR scan has been used in other studies and information from those other research studies suggest that this imaging technique may help to better detect differences in the structure of the heart muscle after treatment with doxorubicin. In this research study, we hope that we can better detect changes in the heart muscle after treatment with doxorubicin with a CMR scan in the hopes that cardiac injury can be detected and treated earlier to ultimately prevent the possible development of heart failure",NO,Lymphoma,DEVICE: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Scan,"Myocardial ECV, - To determine if a novel cardiac magnetic resonance-based index, the extracellular volume fraction (ECV), of myocardial fibrosis is altered early after doxorubicin-based chemotherapy., 2 Years","Alteration of serum biomarkers after doxorubicin based chemotherapy, - To determine if serum biomarkers of cardiac stress, collagen turn-over, and myocardial injury are altered after doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, 2 years|Alteration of echocardiographic indices after doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, - To determine if conventional and novel echocardiographic indices are altered after doxorubicin-based chemotherapy., 2 Years|Measurement of cardiopulmonary functional capacity, - To determine if measures of cardiopulmonary functional capacity are abnormal after doxorubicin-based chemotherapy., 2 years|Determine association between measurements pre- and post-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, - To determine if there is an association between CMR, echocardiographic, serum, and functional measures pre- and post doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, 2 Years",,Massachusetts General Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,0,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,11-443,2013-03,2018-08-25,2018-08-25,2013-07-24,,2018-09-14,"Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Insitute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States",

NCT03678337,Prevention and Pharmacological Management of Cardiac Adverse Drug Reactions Induced by Drugs Used in Oncology.,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03678337,PICARO,UNKNOWN,"Recently, the medical management of cancer patients has considerably improved the prognosis of these patients and today some cancers are becoming ""chronic diseases"". As a result, new adverse effects (AEs) are observed, particularly cardiac.

These ""new"" cardiac AEs are the consequence of a significant increase in patients life expectancy (delayed AEs not previously seen) but also the use of new pharmacological classes of anticancer drugs such as kinase inhibitors. The incidence of these cardiac AEs varies according to the patient profile and the anticancer molecules used, but their impact on the morbidity and mortality of the patients is significant.

In this context, we started at the University Hospital of Caen Normandy in September 2017 a cardio-oncology program entitled ""prevention and pharmacological management of cardiac adverse effects induced by drugs used in Oncology"" (PICARO program). This program involves the pharmacology department (opening of a dedicated consultation), the cardiology department (opening of a dedicated ultrasound consultation), vascular medicine departement (opening of a dedicated consultation) and the oncology federation. This program aims to be regional in the future. We therefore propose to build a cohort backed up to the PICARO program to assess the regional impact of cardiac AEs of anticancer drugs and thus to be better able to specify the number of AEs, the incidence and regional prevalence of these drugs. .

The constitution of this cohort is only the first step towards the constitution in the near future (2 years) of an observatory and then a regional registry of cardiac AEs induced by anticancer drugs. The objectives associated with the establishment of such a registry would be to reduce the number of cardiac AEs, the hospitalizations caused by these AEs, a better information of health professionals and patients, an improvement in the screening of patients at risk, all coming back in the context of health, clinical, epidemiological and pharmacological surveillance.",NO,Cardio-oncology,OTHER: observational cohort with plasma samples,"Number of Participants With AntiCancer Drugs-Related Cardiac Adverse Events during the follow-up, 2 years","Plasmatic tests to predict anticancer drugs-related cardiac adverse events from the constitution of the plasma biobank, 2 years",,"University Hospital, Caen",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,200,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2018-A00429-46,2019-02-26,2020-09-10,2021-01,2018-09-19,,2019-04-04,"CHU Caen, Caen, Normandy, 14000, France",

The administration of ATCs can lead to an increase in the risk of the Left Ventricular Systolic dysfunction (LVSD) which ranges from 6 to 15% at 1 year, and of heart failure from which impact at 3.5 years can reach 5%. The major issue in the management of this toxicity is the early identification of this population for monitoring and prevention. No pharmacological intervention strategy is currently recommended.

According to the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology, this identification is based on the measurement of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the overall longitudinal strain (SLG) before and after the last administration of ATC ( at D84 or D126, depending on the duration of the chemotherapy protocol). Recent studies have evaluated the diagnostic performance of earlier strategies highlighting the benefit of SLG measured after 150 mg / m2 of ATC (D42). However, the tools are lacking to detect these patients as close as possible to the onset of ATC, a necessary condition for effective secondary prevention.

Since the short duration of the majority of breathless episodes limits the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions (e.g. opioids), non-pharmacological management strategies play a major role. As non-pharmacological strategies patients use, for example, cognitive and behavioural methods such as breathing or relaxation techniques.

The aim of the study is to test a brief cognitive and behavioural intervention for an improved management of episodic breathlessness. Initially, a Delphi procedure with international experts has been used to develop the brief intervention consisting of various non-pharmacological strategies to enhance the management of breathless episodes.

In the single-arm therapeutic exploratory trial (phase II), the feasibility and potential effects of the brief intervention, such as patient-reported breathlessness mastery, episodic breathlessness characteristics, quality of life, symptom burden, caregivers' burden, and breathlessness in general will be examined.

This required a functioning brain orchestrating the evaluation of the threat and choosing the response, this is a mind-mediated phenomenon. If the response is excessive it contributes to high BP, if deficient to low BP, and the BP itself will identify the allostatic pattern, which in turn will play an important role in the development of the comorbidities.

To do so, consecutive patients of any age and gender that visit a cardiologist's office in Medellin, Colombia, are recruited. Individuals are classified according to their arterial BP and allostasis and follow them in time to see what kind of diseases develops the most (including BP) in the follow up according to the categorization of the characteristic chosen and after adjustment for confounder's variables. In addition, stress events with their date are registered.

HYPOTHESIS

The causes of the diseases are multifactorial.

Physical, biochemical, psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of development dynamically interact to shape the health development process.

A person´s health depends on their:

1. Biological and physiologic systems
2. External and internal environment (a) physical, b) internal behavioural and arousal state as registered by the brain.
3. Their interaction.

The allostatic mechanisms to the internal and external stressors (allostatic load) involves a network composed by:

1. Functional systems; mediated by:

   1. The Autonomic Nervous System
   2. The endocrine system
   3. The immune system
2. Structural changes: whenever the internal and/or external stressors are long lasting and/or strength enough, they may induce changes in:

   1. Epigenetic, endophenotypes, polyphenism.
   2. Plasticity
3. The interaction between a) and b).

The network response do not affect exclusively the BP, propitiating the development of comorbidities, which may prompt strategies for prevention, recognition and ultimately, treatment.

The allostatic model defines health as a state of responsiveness.

The concept of psycho-biotype: The allostasis is the result of both: biological (allostasis) and psychological (psychostasis) abilities. It is proposed that both components behave in similar direction and magnitude.

Immune disorders may be associated with the development of cancer. High BP population has a higher sympathetic and lower vagal tone, this has been associated with a decrease in the immune´s system function.

Resources and energy depletion: Terms like weathering have been used to describe how exposures to different allostatic loads gradually scrape away at the protective coating that keeps people healthy. It is postulated that High BP individuals have more resources and energy.",NO,Blood Pressure|Depression|Panic Attack|Fibromyalgia|POTS|Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia|Coronary Heart Disease|Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)|Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)|Cerebrovascular Disease (CVD)|Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)|Atrial Fibrillation|Diabetes Mellitus|Cancer|Systolic Heart Failure|Diastolic Heart Failure|Chronic Fatigue Syndrome|Syncope|Vasovagal Syncope,,"Relationship between Blood pressure group and comorbidities, Blood pressure group: 1) Essential arterial hypotension, 2) normotension and 3) Essential arterial hypertension.

Advances in cancer therapies have led to increasing numbers of adults previously treated for a pediatric malignancy, many of whom experience late adverse health-related sequelae and are at risk for developing chronic conditions related to their prior therapy. The epidemiology of many end-organ toxicities has been described, yet the pathophysiologic mechanisms of injury are incompletely understood. One mechanism may be damage to the circulatory system, in particular the endothelial layer, initiating an inflammatory state leading to dysfunction and premature atherosclerotic disease. This process may begin and significantly progress in a sub-clinical nature for many years prior to manifesting as a cardio- or cerebrovascular event. Using established and novel biomarkers predictive of atherosclerotic disease combined with unique measurements of vascular function, this study will assess pre-clinical vascular disease in a population of childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.

In addition, the study allows evaluation of the biochemical response (5-HIAA and chromogranin-A), the reduction in the number of daily cutaneous flushing episodes, the improvement in abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life, improvement in gastro-intestinal and endocrine symptoms, changes in emotional functioning, the impact of discontinuation of telotristat ethyl/placebo on HRQOL and symptoms, and the safety and toxicity of the treatment.

Patients will enter into a screening/run-in period of 1 week to establish baseline characteristics and symptomatology. The baseline assessment of daily bowel movement, as assessed in an electronic diary, will be averaged over the run-in period.

Following the screening/run-in period, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either the control arm or the experimental arm for 12 months. Randomization will be stratified according to the grade of tumour differentiation (grade 1 vs. grade 2) and by baseline number of bowel movements per day (4-6 versus \>6). A total of 94 patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either arm.

Upon randomization, all patients will enter the 12-month treatment period with lanreotide + telotristat ethyl/placebo (blinded). In the experimental arm, patients will receive the deep subcutaneous injection of lanreotide (120 mg) every 28 days and 250 mg orally three times daily (TID) of telotristat ethyl for 12 months. In the control arm, patients will receive the deep subcutaneous injection of lanreotide every 28 days (120 mg) and placebo orally TID for 12 months.

After completion of a minimum of 6 months on randomized blinded-treatment, the protocol allows for patients on treatment with telotristat ethyl/placebo to be unblinded in the event of ""lack of symptom control"". Unblinding due to ""lack of symptom control"" can happen at any time between 6 and 12 months of the blinded-treatment period. After unblinding, patient will interrupt protocol treatment and will be further treated as per clinician discretion.

All patients will be unblinded after a maximum of 12 months on randomized blinded-treatment.

After a follow-up of 12 months, patients will go off study except patients with carcinoid heart disease. Patients off study will be further treated as per clinician discretion.

Patients with carcinoid heart disease will continue open-label treatment on study (lanreotide + telotristat ethyl or lanreotide alone according to what they were receiving at unblinding at 12 months) for 4 additional years (open-label extension period). Patients with carcinoid heart disease who discontinue protocol treatment before 12 months will also enter the extension period for additional follow-up. Additional follow-up will last 4 years for these patients and will include 6-monthly cardiological assessments.

All efficacy analyses will be conducted in the Intention-to-treat population as primary analyses i.e. all 94 randomized patients will be analyzed in the arm they were allocated by randomization. Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population i.e. on all patients who have received at least one dose of the study drugs.

The translational research projects include blood metabolite discovery and targeted assays to find new biomarker candidates of response to Telotristat.

Human biological material that will be collected for translational research purpose:

* whole blood, plasma and serum at baseline, 4 hours after first dose, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and at end of treatment visit with telotristat/placebo (due to end of study, disease progression or lack of benefit)
* archival tissue samples (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) will be retrieved for all patients at study entry. In addition, one EDTA blood tube of whole blood (10 ml) at baseline, 12 weeks and end of treatment (EOT visit) might be also collected for not yet pre-defined and further translational research.

NCT04852965,Late Anthracycline Induced Cardiotoxicity- Childhood Cancer Survivors,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04852965,,RECRUITING,"Anthracyclines treat up to 60% of childhood malignancies with remarkable improvements survival rates. Unfortunately anthracyclines are associated with an increased cardiomyopathy risk. One study showed an almost six-fold greater risk of developing cardiomyopathy compared to sibling controls. A retrospective pilot study showed evidence of subclinical dysfunction (including impaired global longitudinal strain) in 42/52 childhood cancer survivors. There is limited research in this area, therefore current guidelines are based on expert opinion alone and lack consensus. Current methods of detection diagnose cardiomyopathy at an irreversible stage i.e. when the compensatory mechanisms are exhausted and the left ventricular ejection fraction impaired. Small trials have shown that early treatment with standard heart failure therapy may reverse damage, further validation is however required in this cohort.

Newer techniques such as tissue doppler and strain rate imaging have shown promise for early prediction of cardiomyopathy in adult studies. Biomarkers such as troponin and NT-proBNP have also shown a correlation with cardiomyopathy.

This study (n=208) aims to use echocardiography, strain imaging, holter monitoring and MRI for early detection of cardiomyopathy. Biomarkers, both currently used (for example, troponin and NTproBNP,) and more novel (for example, IL6, MPO, and sST2) will be assessed to see if early cardiomyopathy can be predicted.

This study will explore biomarker discovery by analysing an age/gender matched subgroup for the top differentially expressed microRNA and protein biomarkers.

NCT03748030,Hybrid PET/MR Imaging of Acute Cardiac Inflammation After Left-Sided Breast Cancer Radiotherapy,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03748030,RICT-BREAST,UNKNOWN,"Radiation therapy (RT) of the breast is a critical component of modern breast cancer treatment. RT treatments have led to improved local control and overall survival of breast cancer patients. However, the incidence of radiation induced harmful effects is increasing in these patients. This is because in delivering RT, it is difficult to completely avoid surrounding non-cancerous normal tissue, including the heart. The main concern here is that radiation induced effects on the heart may lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in a patient's life, potentially many years after radiation. Despite methods that can detect alterations in blood flow one to two years following radiotherapy, knowledge of early radiation effects to the heart is still limited. A previous animal experiment performed by our group involved delivering a radiation dose to the heart in a manner similar to the way a heart would be exposed, during radiotherapy for a cancer involving the left breast. Taking several images over the months following radiation with a new imaging technique, hybrid PET/MRI, has suggested an increase in inflammation can be detected as early as one-week following irradiation and may be the triggering event for cardiac disease seen in women 10-15 years after radiotherapy. The investigators propose a pilot study where 15 left-sided breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy will be imaged before, as well as one week and one-year post radiotherapy with our hybrid PET/MRI scanner. Areas of inflammation, changes in blood flow, and scar formation within the heart, will be measured by looking at the difference between images that are taken after radiation treatment to the images taken before treatment. The expectation is that any areas of the heart that show detectable differences in the images will be directly related to how much radiation was deposited in those areas. The information gained from this pilot study which will correlate the amount of radiation administered to the degree and extent of injury will help aid in the design of new treatment strategies, that can hopefully decrease or eliminate inadvertent heart damage, thereby, improving the quality of life for breast cancer patients.",NO,Left-Sided Breast Cancer|Radiation Toxicity,RADIATION: Confirmed Left-Sided Breast Cancer,"Detection of Imaging Biomarkers of acute cardiac inflammation, 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET imaging to detect increase in cardiac inflammation compared to baseline with corresponding blood markers (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and troponin levels in blood (inflammation))., one month|Detection of Imaging Biomarkers of late cardiac inflammation, FDG-PET imaging to detect increase in cardiac inflammation compared to baseline with corresponding blood markers (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and troponin levels in blood (inflammation))., one year|Detection of Imaging Biomarkers of acute cardiac perfusion changes, N-13 Ammonia PET imaging to detect changes in acute cardiac perfusion changes compared to baseline., one month|Detection of Imaging Biomarkers of late cardiac perfusion changes, N-13 Ammonia PET imaging to detect changes in late cardiac perfusion changes, one year|Detection of cardiac fibrosis, Gadolinium Enhanced MR imaging to detect cardiac fibrosis compared to baseline, one year",,,Lawson Health Research Institute,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,15,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,112991,2019-01-01,2020-12-31,2021-12-31,2018-11-20,,2018-11-27,"Lawson Health Research Institute, London, Ontario, N6C 2R5, Canada",

Bruton s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) are used to treat a form of leukemia. But taking BTKi can also increase a person s risk of developing an abnormal heart rhythm. This can cause sudden death. In this natural history study, researchers want to learn how BTKi affects the heart.

Objective:

To identify and monitor the effects of BTKi on the heart.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 and older currently receiving or planning to receive BTKi.

Design:

Participants who have not yet started BTKi will have 2 required clinic visits: 1 before they start taking BTKi, and 1 about 6 months later. Participants who are already taking BTKi will have 1 required visit.

Participants will undergo multiple tests:

A physical exam, including collection of blood and saliva.

A test that measures heart activity via stickers placed on the chest.

A test that uses sound waves to capture images of the heart.

An exercise stress test that monitors heart activity and blood pressure while the participant works on a treadmill or stationary bike. Sound wave images of the heart may also be taken while the participant exercises.

Stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done in place of an exercise test. Participants will lie on a table that slides into a tube. They will be given drugs to stress the heart while images are taken.

Participants may wear a device to monitor their heart at home.

Participants may have repeat visits if they develop heart symptoms or if they need to stop taking BTKi.

NCT04143230,Identification of In-hospital Patients in Need of Palliative Care Using a New Simplified Screening Tool,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04143230,SST2017,COMPLETED,"Every day many patients affected by chronic life-limiting illnesses are admitted into Internal Medicine wards, coming from the Emergency Department. Many studies suggest that providing palliative care to these patients may improve their end-of-life care while reducing costs by minimizing futile treatments and unwanted intensive care unit admissions. Consequently, there is a strong need for acute care hospitals to more vigorously identify patients entering the final phase of their lives as well as their specific care needs.

In a previous study the investigators screened for need of palliative care patients affected by progressive chronic diseases by means of a tool, based on the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care - SIAARTI - position paper reporting criteria for patients with end-stage chronic organ failures, and on the specific clinical indicators elaborated by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for patients with locally advanced/metastatic cancer. In a further pilot study, the investigators compared the outcomes of PC patients depending on whether the palliative care team evaluated such patients only if requested by the physician staff or routinely, irrespectively of a specific request, finding a significant increase of discharges after the activation of an appropriate PC service or scheduled PC ambulatory visit.

In the present study the investigators enroll chronically ill patients admitted to an Internal Medicine Unit from the Emergency Department, to be screened for palliative care need, using the previously cited SIAARTI/NCCN screening tool (Extended Screening Tool - EST), or using a Simplified Screening Tool (SST), derived from the first instrument, which preliminary showed a superimposable efficacy. This latter tool has advantages related to much more shortness and therefore simplicity in the administration to a seriously ill patient and is much less time consuming, allowing the physician to use it routinely.

The aim of the study is to verify the accuracy of the SST in identifying chronically ill patients in need of a PC approach, in comparison to the SIAARTI/NCCN tool (EST).

METHODS: Eligible patients with a known diagnosis of chronic heart, lung, liver, and kidney failures, or advanced cancer, awaiting to be hospitalized after an ED visit, were assessed with both screening tools (ie, EST and SST).

Between 20 and 40% of patients in primary care, and about 50% in secondary care experience PPS. Not only are PPS common, but the overlap across different patient groups may indicate that these phenomena are transdiagnostic. PPS are associated with profound disability and high health care costs, and if left untreated the prognosis of these patients is poor. There is an accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that cognitive behavioural interventions can reduce levels of symptoms and improve functioning in patients with PPS. A pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) was designed to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) + Standard Medical Care (SMC) versus Standard Medical Care alone, in the treatment of patients with PPS.

NCT03694431,Comparative Trial of Home-Based Palliative Care,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03694431,HomePal,TERMINATED,"Background: To effectively alleviate suffering and improve quality of life for patients with serious illness and their caregivers, palliative care (PC) services must be offered across multiple settings. Research is needed to determine how best to optimize home-based palliative care (HBPC) services to meet the needs of individuals with high symptom burden and functional limitations.

Aim: The investigators will compare a standard HBPC model that includes routine home visits by a nurse and provider with a more efficient tech-supported HBPC model that promotes timely inter-professional team coordination via synchronous video consultation with the provider while the nurse is in the patient's home. The investigators hypothesize that tech-supported HBPC will be as effective as standard HBPC.

Design: Cluster randomized trial. Registered nurses (n\~130) will be randomly assigned to the tech-supported or standard HBPC model so that half of the patient-caregiver dyads will receive one of the two models.

Setting/Participants: Kaiser Permanente (15 Southern California and Oregon sites). Patients (n=10,000) with any serious illness and a prognosis of 1-2 years and their caregivers (n=4,800)

Methods: Patients and caregivers will receive standard PC services: comprehensive needs assessment and care planning, pain and symptom management, education/skills training, medication management, emotional/spiritual support; care coordination, referral to other services, and 24/7 phone assistance.

Results: Primary patient outcomes: symptom improvement at 1 month and days spent at home in the last six months of life; caregiver outcome: perception of preparedness for caregiving.

According to the World Cancer Research Fund International, there were more than 2.25 million new cases of breast cancer in women in 2020. Although the modern treatment strategies, based on the complex care, which consists of surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted chemotherapy directed at specific cancer molecules have substantially reduced the risk of death due to breast cancer, their wide adoption results in the wider prevalence of cardiotoxicity, defined as either symptomatic heart failure, or asymptomatic contractile dysfunction. The occurrence of cardiotoxicity induced by anti-cancer therapies is estimated at 5-15%, and its development is the primary cause of therapy termination, which significantly reduces the probability of the efficacy of treatment. Several attempts have been made to determine the efficacious preventive strategy, which could diminish the risk of cancer-therapy induced cardiotoxicity. The results of the prior studies indicated a trend towards lower risk of troponin elevation, or left ventricular contractile dysfunction with the introduction of drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) axis, which constitute the primary treatment modality in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sacubitril/valsartan, the novel therapeutic agent, has been demonstrated to significantly improve prognosis in patients with HFrEF. Prior retrospective, small, single-center studies have shown that treatment with sacubitril/valsartan may reduce the risk of cancer-therapy induced cardiotoxicity, or reverse contractile dysfunction caused by anti-cancer therapy. However, no large randomized data confirmed these findings. Therefore, the Sacubitril/Valsartan in PriMAry preventIoN of the cardiotoxicity of systematic breaST canceR trEAtMent) study, has been designed to verify, whether the preventive use of sacubitril/valsartan administered in the doses recommended in patients with HFrEF in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclines or anthracyclines and HER-2 monoclonal antibodies, will reduce the incidence of cardiotoxicity defined as impaired left ventricular systolic function on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the trial, a total of 480 patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer, who are eligible for chemotherapy with anthracyclines or anthracyclines and HER-2 monoclonal antibodies, will undergo 1:1 randomization to either preventive treatment with sacubitril/valsartan or placebo. The patients will be followed for 24 months, and will have repetitive efficacy and safety examinations, including echocardiography, MRI, electrocardiography including 24-h Holter monitoring, blood tests, functional capacity tests and quality of life assessment.",NO,"Breast Cancer|Neoplasm, Breast|Breast Diseases|Antihypertensive Agents|Sacubitril/Valsartan|Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers|Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists|Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action|Heart Failure|Cardiac Toxicity|Cancer, Therapy-Related|Cancer Therapy-Related Cardiac Dysfunction|Cardiotoxicity",DRUG: Sacubitril-valsartan,"Decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 5%, Reduction of LVEF assessed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), At 12 months from the randomization visit","Death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure, Composite clinical endpoint, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Death from any cause, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Death from cardiovascular causes, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Hospitalization for other cardiovascular causes, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 5%, Reduction of LVEF assessed on echocardiography, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Occurrence of diastolic dysfunction (UKG) within 24 months of randomization, Diastolic dysfunction assessed on echocardiography, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|- Development of pathological pericardial fluid volume or increase in pericardial fluid volume from baseline, Assessed with any available clinical modality, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Occurrence of cardiac tamponade, Assessed with any clinical modality, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Occurrence of pericarditis, Assessed with any clinical modality, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Occurrence of myocarditis, Assessed with any clinical modality, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Development of ventricular arrhythmias, Assessed with any clinical modality, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Development of supraventricular arrhythmias, Assessed with any clinical modality, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Presence of conduction disturbances, Assessed with any clinical modality, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Changes in corrected QT interval, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months|Changes in BNP, NT pro-BNP, troponin T or troponin I levels, Assessed with serial laboratory measurements, From Randomization till the end of blinded therapy - at 24 months",,Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases,"Medical Research Agency, Poland",FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,600,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION",LCZ696ABM001.001,2023-02,2027-12,2028-02,2022-07-19,,2022-07-19,"Regional Cancer Centre in Opole, Opole, Opolskie, 45-061, Poland|Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute - Oncology Centre (MSCI), Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Silesia, 44102, Poland|Silesian Center for Heart Diseases, Zabrze, Silesia, 41800, Poland|Holy Cross Cancer Centre, Cardio-Oncology Division, Kielce, Świętokrzyskie, 25-734, Poland",

NCT02541435,Acute and Long-term Cardiovascular Toxicity After Modern Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02541435,,RECRUITING,"In Europe, breast cancer is by far the most common form of cancer diagnosed in women today, accounting for 29% of all cases. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 90%. Surgery is usually combined with radiotherapy (RT), anthracyclines, aromatase inhibitors and/or trastuzumab (Herceptin) which all have improved the life expectancy and survival in breast cancer patients.

Unfortunately, RT is associated with a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, which includes coronary artery disease, valvular dysfunction, congestive heart failure and stroke, and is the most common non-malignancy cause of death. During the last two decades, RT regimens for breast cancer have changed and the doses of radiation to which the heart is exposed are now potentially lower due to new and improved RT techniques. However, there are no data on whether these new regimes decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.

In this study the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases will be estimated 8 and 15 years after both conventional and laser assisted breath controlled RT, and compared with cardiovascular diseases in the general female population. A further aim is to evaluate signs and prevalence of acute cardiotoxicity from RT with the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, coronary fractional flow reserve, ECG and inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers and to investigate whether these signs can predict later cardiovascular disease.

NCT04729634,Survey Of Mobilisation and Breathing Exercises After Thoracic and Abdominal Surgery,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04729634,SOMBATA,COMPLETED,"Background

Thoracic or abdominal surgeries are followed by a shorter or longer period of immobilization and after major surgery there is a higher risk of developing cardiorespiratory complications. To prevent these complications, the patient is encouraged to change position and exercise in bed, get out of bed as early and as much as possible after the operation and to breathe with or without aids. There is no general definition of early mobilization and may start within a few hours to a few days after surgery. There is currently a lack of knowledge nationally and internationally about when the mobilization starts and what it contains.

Many patients also receive breathing training in connection with the surgery. There is currently no consensus on which method is preferable for which groups of patients. There are similarities and differences in practice in the world regarding postoperative breathing training. There are studies that have mapped practice after primarily thoracic surgery but also abdominal surgery. However, there are no studies that have mapped when the prescribed breathing training starts after different types of operations.

The purpose of the study is to map when mobilization and breathing training starts after abdominal and thoracic surgery and what is then performed

Method The study will be carried out as a quality follow-up with mapping of practice. Patients ≥ 18 years of age who are undergoing a planned or acute open, keyhole or robot-assisted surgery, who are extubated and who breathe spontaneously will be included. Exclusion criteria are completed plastic, trauma, orthopedic or transplant surgery.

The material will be recruited from Swedish university hospitals and county hospitals for 20 days of surgery (Monday through Thursday) for five consecutive weeks.

HRVB is a biofeedback approach that provides clients with real time feedback about their heart rate variability (HRV) as a means of teaching them how to breathe in a specific, therapeutic manner.

More specifically, this study has been designed to test several hypothesises. Each hypothesis is based on the prediction that, in a sample of psychologically distressed PBT survivors, a course of 8 HRVB sessions will demonstrate:

* statistically significant reductions in levels of depression
* statistically significant reductions in levels of anxiety
* statistically significant increases in resting HRV
* that reductions in anxiety and depression will be significantly, negatively correlated with increases in resting HRV
* that the HRVB will be viewed as an acceptable intervention by the participants

NCT05132998,Impact of a Comprehensive Cardiac Rehabilitation Program Framework Among High Cardiovascular Risk Cancer Survivors,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05132998,,COMPLETED,"Many cancer survivors are at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD); it is therefore important to identify patients at increased risk for cardiotoxicity, especially in the setting of CVRF or pre-existing CVD, and to design personalized interventions to prevent cardiovascular morbidity. In this background, cardio-oncology rehabilitation frameworks for specific cancer patients have been proposed. Given potential beneficial effects of exercise among cancer patients (including those at higher risk of CVD), data pertaining to optimal program designs are of paramount contemporary importance.

Thus, the aim of this study is to compare the impact of a Cardiac Rehabilitation Program (CRP) model versus a community-based exercise intervention plus usual care on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), physical function domains and CVRF control in adult cancer survivors who have been exposed to cardiotoxic cancer treatment and/or with cardiovascular medical background.

1. Examine the correlation between mean symptom severity scores and the secondary endpoints of: a) exercise tolerance ( 6-minute walk), b) NYHA (New York Heart Association) functional classification, c) B-type natriuretic peptide (a biomarker for heart failure), and d) dose titration of HF (heart failure) medications.

NCT04826601,The Physical and Psychologic Effects of Aromatherapy in Cancer Patients During Chemotherapy,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04826601,,UNKNOWN,"Background: Stress is the critical method for survive of reacting to a condition including a threat, challenge or physical and psychological challenge. Stress either physiological or biological is an organism's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition. Stimuli that alter an organism's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system are major systems which the body reacts to the stress. It has been reported that cancer patients receiving chemotherapy perceived a lot of stress. It has been believed and well known that stress-related illness is one of the reasons contributing to the increase in long-term sick leave during the last decade in many countries.

Purpose: The aims of this study are to evaluate the effects of aromatherapy on cancer patient receiving chemotherapy: 1) for physical effects by meridian electrical conductance, heart rate variability (HRV), vital sign, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain; 2) for psychologic effects by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).

Materials and methods: This is a prospective, pre post comparison study. A total of 40 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy will be recruited as participants in this study. The characteristics data will be collected in all participants. Blood orange and rosewood will be chosen as the essential oils for aromatherapy in this study. Essential oils will be applied to all participants by inhalation for 30 minutes. Meridian electrical conductance, HRV, vital sign, VAS for pain, and STAI were evaluated and compared before and after aromatherapy.

Expected outcomes: It is expected to understand more about the effects of aromatherapy on the meridian system, HRV and emotional status by undertaking 30 minutes session aromatherapy intervention for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

NCT02794324,The HeartSpare Study (Stage I),https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02794324,,COMPLETED,"Radiotherapy (RT) has a major curative role in women with early breast cancer, and is recommended routinely after lumpectomy and selectively after mastectomy. It has contributed to a halving of breast cancer mortality in the UK over the last 2 decades despite ever-rising cancer incidence. RT in women with left-sided tumours often exposes the underlying heart to a damaging dose. The heart is very sensitive to RT, and there were 1-2 deaths from heart disease for every 100 breast cancer patients treated during the 1960s-70s. The situation has improved in recent years, but standard RT techniques still deliver significant radiation doses to heart tissue.

Two potentially simple techniques reduce heart dose. In one, women are taught to breathe in deeply and to hold their breath for about 20 seconds while RT is given. The downward movement of the diaphragm pulls the heart away from the RT beam. In the other technique, women lie on their fronts, instead of on their backs as they normally do for breast RT. In this position, the breast falls away from the rib cage and reduces exposure of the heart. Neither technique is routinely available to women receiving breast RT in the UK for reasons that this research aims to address. The investigators need to: 1) confirm that patient position can be reproduced with millimetre precision every day using these techniques, 2) minimise costs of equipment, time and personnel required to support such techniques, 3) select the most appropriate technique for different patients and 4) train staff in centres across the UK to deliver techniques safely and effectively. By addressing all of these issues, the study aims ultimately to make heart-sparing RT available to all UK women that might benefit from treatment, thereby significantly reducing the burden of heart disease in breast cancer survivors.",NO,Breast Cancer,PROCEDURE: Voluntary deep-inspiratory breath hold|PROCEDURE: Active-breathing-controlled deep-inspiratory breathhold|PROCEDURE: Prone treatment|DEVICE: Active-breathing-controlled deep-inspiratory breathhold,"Interfraction reproducibility of chest wall position (group A), The position of ipsilateral chest wall will be compared between the digitally reconstructed radiographs (derived from the planning CT) and the on-treatment electronic portal images and mean daily displacements calculated., End of radiotherapy (3-4 weeks)|Difference in mean left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) mean normal tissue dose (NTDmean) (group B), Using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) based on the planning scan and on-treatment CBCT imaging, mean LAD NTDmean will be compared for ABC_DIBH versus prone positioning., End of radiotherapy (3-4 weeks)","Difference in NTDmean for heart, LAD, ipsilateral and whole lungs (group A), End of radiotherapy (3-4 weeks)|Comparison of standard deviation in mean LAD NTDmean over a treatment course (group B), End of radiotherapy (3-4 weeks)|Comparison of individual patient heart NTDmean differences by anatomical factors (group B), End of radiotherapy (3-4 weeks)|Difference in mean normal tissue doses (NTDmean) to heart, ipsilateral and whole lungs (group B), End of radiotherapy (3-4 weeks)|Difference in volumes of chest wall receiving 20Gy (Groups A and B), End of radiotherapy (3-4 weeks)|Interfraction reproducibility of chest wall position (groups A and B), End of radiotherapy (3-4 weeks)|Interfraction reproducibility of tumour bed position (groups A and B), End of radiotherapy (3-4 weeks)|Time and equipment costs (groups A and B), End of study (2 years)|Patient and radiographer satisfaction with positioning technique (groups A and B), Weekly questionnaire",,Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2|PHASE3,57,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CCR3593,2012-02,2014-05,2014-05,2016-06-09,,2016-06-09,"The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Sutton, SM2 5PT, United Kingdom",

After prospectively evaluating 20 healthy individuals or 40 patients with advanced breast cancer or hepatocarcinoma, it was possible to determine subtle hemodynamic changes consistent with the biofeedback effect associated with exposure to a cancer-specific set of modulated frequencies.

Once CEMBE is administered through an intra-oral administration device, the human body absorbs the energy applied at the level of 0.2-1 mW / kg, with a peak absorption in 10 g of tissue between 55 and 132 mW / kg. Initially, the discriminatory study analyzing 9 hemodynamic parameters recorded beat heart beat in 18 individuals demonstrated a hemodynamic pattern specific for hepatocarcinoma and breast cancer, with sensitivity of 94.1% and 95%, respectively, and specificity of 75% and 95%, respectively. These findings were validated in blind analysis in the remaining 56 patients, confirming the high rate of discriminatory success.

A specific pattern of response associated with exposure of a cancer-specific frequency group was also observed in patients diagnosed with neoplasia, since the control group of healthy individuals did not present these response patterns.

It is therefore a prospective randomized double- blind study, where we do a clinical trial in patients ASA(American Society of Anesthesiologists) 1 and 2 statuses between 18 and 80 years of age, using the ultrasound in plane technology.Upon arrival of patients in the unit for preparation procedures for anesthesia we set the ECG(electrocardiograph), noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and arterial cannula in the radial artery After sterile washing of the dorsal surface, paravertebral space was identified with ultrasound using 8 Hz(hertz) linear transducer probe then needle position was confirmed with neurostimulation at the level of 2.0 - 5.0 mA(milliampere). When muscle contraction persisted at 0.4mA(milliampere), the anesthetic was applied in levels of Th 2, Th3, and Th 4 (7,0 milliliters per level). We applied the 0.5 % levobupivacaine and 2 % lidocaine, 7,0 milliliters of mixture per level in one group, while only 0.5 % levobupivacaine also 7,0 milliliters. by level in the second one. After that, the invasive hemodynamic monitoring was placed on patients and the induction with 1 % propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg.and Vecuronium 0,08 mg/kg. was performed with the application of supraglottic airway gel of appropriate size. The maintenance of anesthesia and sedation will be conducted with Propofol 1 % continuously ( 25-150 mcg / kg / min.)The measurements will be taken every 5 minutes during the first hour of the application of paravertebral block, then every 15 minutes during the second hour and if the operation takes more than two hours, the measurements are performed every 30 minutes. Postoperatively, invasive hemodynamic monitoring will be removed in post-anesthesia recovery room together with the arterial cannula and the patient will be sent to the hospital ward with non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure, pulse, saturation) until the termination of the blocks.Statistical methods, By comparing two target groups, we analysed the strength of the test with following assumptions: X2 difference test, the expected difference in variances in stroke volume between groups of 60%, α significance level of 0.05, and the minimum statistical test strength of 85%. The required total sample should include at least 80 patients, that is, 40 per group.Data will be presented in tables and graphs. Descriptive statistics of examined variables with appropriate measures of central tendency will be made. Smirnov -Kolmogorov test will assess the normality of data distribution. According to the received results, the appropriate parametric and / or nonparametric tests will be used. Comparisons of quantitative values between the two groups will be analyzed using the independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Dependent values within each group will be analyzed using analysis of variance for repeated measures or Friedman test. Differences in categorical values will be analyzed by X2 test. The appropriate regression model will be made in order to predict the variability of stroke volume in which the dependent variable will be a variation of the stroke volume, while relevant clinical values will be taken as predictor variables. All P values smaller than 0.05 will be considered significant.

This research is to present the main results - the existence of the significant change in Stroke Volume Variation (SVV) between groups using invasive hemodynamic monitoring, the changes of Stroke Volume Variation(SVV) depending on the time from the application within groups, differences in volume compensation of crystalloids and colloids and the need for the application of vasoactive drugs.

Fat and calcium can build up as plaque in artery walls. The Agatston score measures plaque using computed tomography (CT) that does not use an injected contrast agent. Plaque in the arteries of the pelvis and abdomen is linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. It also may affect cancer. But abdominal CTs use a contrast agent (CECT). Therefore, the Agatston score cannot be used. Researchers want to find a way to measure plaque in CECTs. This will help them use abdominal CTs to measure plaque without extra radiation.

Objective:

To measure atherosclerotic plaques on CECT in a group of males.

Eligibility:

Men ages 30-90 with prostate cancer (proven with biopsies) who have abdomen CT studies in the PACS (picture archiving system) in the Clinical Center. Also, men or women of all ages who have multiphase abdomen and pelvic CT studies that are in the PACS.

Design:

This study will use data gathered since 1/1/2013. Data will also be taken from protocol 03-CC-0128 and clinical trials 15-C-0124, 16-C-0048, 14-C-0112, and 04-C-0274. Participants from these studies have allowed their samples to be used in the future.

Participants will be found via keyword searches on NIH databases. Their CT and MRI scans will be used. Data such as age, race, disease, and treatment will be used. Results of other tests may be used.

The plaque in participants abdomen and iliac arteries will be measured. It will be compared with biomarkers related to CVD and prostate cancer, such as weight, age, and race.

The investigators are developing a blood test to detect cancer from a simple blood draw also referred to as a liquid biopsy. This test is based on orphan non-coding RNAs (oncRNAs) that are abundant in the blood of patients with cancer and largely absent in people without cancer. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) investigators are able to interpret the thousands of oncRNAs found in the blood of patients with cancer by identifying unique, cancer-specific patterns. oncRNA patterns can be used to detect several types of cancer and detect cancer at the earliest stages.

The investigators have designed the study to include participants without cancer, participants with conditions that are a predisposition for cancer, participants with pre-malignant lesions, and participants with cancer. Patients with a wide variety of cancers are going to be included i.e. bladder, breast, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, kidney, liver, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and uterine cancer.

Each participant will be asked to donate a small blood sample and to share their medical information. The participant's medical information will be updated during the course of the study. The blood will be tested for oncRNA. The objective is to create a blood repository and associated medical database to develop a blood test for cancer, for different cancer types. The study is designed to be inclusive and represent the population in America.

If this study is successful, the results will enable a world where cancer can be detected early with a simple blood test and diagnosed accurately, with better chances of cure. The investigators believe this study has the potential to transform cancer detection in America.",NO,Kidney Cancer|Liver Cancer|Lung Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer|Prostate Cancer|Uterine Cancer|Bladder Cancer|Breast Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Esophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Arthritis|Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy|Chronic Kidney Diseases|COPD|Chronic Prostatitis|Depression|Diabetes|Heart Failure|Hypercholesterolemia|Hypertension|Ischemic Heart Disease|Inflammatory Bowel Diseases|Chronic Pancreatitis|Cirrhosis|Hepatitis|Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease|Helicobacter Pylori Infection|Advanced Adenocarcinoma|Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm|Gastric Polyp|DCIS,DEVICE: Exai oncRNA blood test,"Optimize non-invasive cancer biomarker tests based on its small noncoding (snc)RNA technology, Analyze small noncoding (snc)RNA profiles differentially expressed in specimens obtained from case and control subjects to identify candidate sncRNA biomarkers for use in deriving and optimizing oncRNA diagnostic models for multiple cancer applications, including screening, early diagnosis, minimal residual disease and monitoring for tumor recurrence, Seven years|Optimize oncRNA test clinical performance, Assess small noncoding (snc)RNA profiles potentially associated with demographic parameters, medication use, comorbid conditions, and/or cancer-predisposing conditions which might overlap with candidate cancer biomarkers to optimize oncRNA model clinical specificity performance, i.e., minimize false positives., Seven years",,,Exai Bio Inc.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,2400,INDUSTRY,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,CP-23001,2023-07-30,2030-07-30,2030-07-30,2023-04-27,,2023-06-18,,

This study will involve 2 phases. Firstly, potential volunteers will be invited to meet the research fellow (medical doctor) undertaking this study, who will check their suitability to participate in the study and who will obtain informed consent.

The second phase is the study itself which will take place whilst volunteers are having their bowel operation. They will attend theatre in the normal way, but once they have been anaesthetised (put to sleep), a special monitor called an oesophageal doppler probe will be placed into their oesophagus (food pipe) via the nose. This monitor is frequently used in bowel surgery to help assess how much intravenous fluid to administer to a patient by measuring the cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped out of the heart each minute). Using the cannula (drip) already inserted in the arm to allow administration of the anaesthetic, a special fluid, called an ultrasound contrast agent, will be injected into the drip, to allow a contrast enhanced ultrasound scan of the abdominal organs to be performed, to measure the blood flow to these organs. A small sample of blood will be taken from the earlobe to allow us to measure a chemical in the blood called lactate.

After this, intravenous fluid will be administered in order to increase the amount of blood pumped out of the heart. Once the oesophageal doppler monitor suggests that an adequate amount of fluid has been given, a second ultrasound scan will be performed to measure whether blood flow to the abdominal organs has also increased. A further blood sample will be taken from your earlobe to measure any change in lactate level.

At the completion of the operation, a third ultrasound scan will be performed and another sample of blood taken from the earlobe, to help assess blood flow to the organs.",NO,Patients Undergoing Open Resection of Colorectal Tumours,DRUG: Hartmann's solution,"Changes in microvascular blood flow during colorectal surgery, Immediately following optimisation of cardiac output",,,University of Nottingham,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,32,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,13115,2015-01,2016-01,2016-06,2014-05-12,,2015-01-27,"Royal Derby Hospital, Derby, Derbyshire, DE22 3NE, United Kingdom",

Approximately 75-80% of these patients are not diagnosed with coronary disease or other cardiac findings. However, many of these patients still report chest pain and worries about cardiac disease.

This study is based on patients that are referred to a CT-examination of the coronary arteries on the background of chest pain, where the CT-examination shows normal coronary arteries.

The study aims to evaluate whether providing an intervention to this group of patients has an effect on patient satisfaction, patient's worry of cardiac disease and incidence of chest pain.

The intervention group will be compared with a similar group going through the same CT-examination, but is receiving the examination result from their regular general practitioner (RGP), which is considered standard care.

NCT04885088,Smart Home Care of Cloud Base ECG on the Cardiotoxicity Prevention on the Cancer Patients.,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04885088,AI,UNKNOWN,"Thoracic malignancy is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide.1,2 The incidence of thoracic malignancy has decreased in North America, but not in Asia, where it continues to show an increasing trend. A notable manifestation of the bimodal age distribution of thoracic malignancy has been observed in women. The occurrence of early-onset thoracic malignancy in the Asian population is earlier than that in the Western population, resulting in a higher incidence of thoracic malignancy in young Asian women. Moreover, the late onset age distribution of patients with thoracic malignancy in Asia (40-50 years) is earlier than that in Western countries (60-70 years), peaking at the age of 45-50 years in most women. The age-specific incidence rates of thoracic malignancy increase sharply until the menopausal stage.

Cardiovascular morbidity is higher among women with thoracic malignancy involving the thorax who had received radiotherapy (RT) compared with those not involving the thorax but receiving the same treatment. Thus far, the risks and time to onset of cardiac complications have been unclear in both young and old women. The proportion of young women with thoracic malignancy is higher in Asia than in Western countries. Furthermore, whether Asian women with thoracic malignancy are susceptible to RT remains unclear.

Anthracyclines are important therapeutic agents for breast cancer. Anthracycline-based regimens have similar or improved outcomes relative to the standard treatment regimen of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. However, cardiotoxicity is a long-term toxicity associated with these regimens. The combined use of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CT) and RT may result in high cardiotoxicity. Nonetheless, no clear information on the effects of this combined therapy on the time to onset of both cardiac complications and cardiotoxicity is available. Furthermore, whether the cardiotoxicity of adjuvant RT and anthracycline-based CT is associated with age and ethnicity in women with thoracic malignancy remains unclear.

Therefore, cardiovascular disease is undoubtedly one of the most challenging health problems in the world. More efforts are needed to prevent and better control of this disease. Our proposed monitoring program is to use AI to monitor the basal value variation of personalized cardiovascular disease in cancer patients before and after chemoradiation. In the first year, our team focused on cardiotoxicity associated with cardiovascular disease models and cancer treatments. In the second year, we will apply knowledge in a clinical setting and calculate the severity of cardiac toxicity and its incidence and time response after cancer treatment.

NCT04718610,"Heart Rate Variability, Vagus Nerve and Cancer",https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04718610,,UNKNOWN,"In France, new cancer cases keep on increasing with around 150 000 deaths yearly. Cancer therapy research is constantly evolving. Indeed, several studies explore new treatments or their combination with conventional cancer treatments. But, at the same time, complementary and alternative medicines, as osteopathy, remain little explored upon their role in the combination with conventional therapy.

Several studies showed indirect interaction between vagus nerve and cancer. Firstly, vagus nerve regulates homeostasis and immunity by reducing systemic inflammation while maintaining local inflammation and antitumor effects. Secondly, vagus nerve stimulation increases Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Moreover, a higher HRV is associated with an improvement of vital prognosis in cancer patients. Vagus nerve could be stimulated by noninvasive osteopathic manipulations.

This prospective, monocentric and randomized study is a collaboration between the Centre Hospitalier d'Avignon and the Institut de Formation en Ostéopathie du Grand Avignon. It focuses on using noninvasive osteopathic mobilizations to stimulate vagus nerve. Indeed, this study aims to evaluate effects of vagus nerve osteopathic stimulations on HRV in patients with lung cancer, colorectal cancer, Non Hodgkin Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma.

Previous research shows that patients suffering from sleep apnoea are much more likely to get heart disease and abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). These defects are sometimes missed by the traditional methods of monitoring i.e. 24-hour Holter monitor and ECGs. This means potentially dangerous arrhythmias may not be detected. Additionally, standard therapy for sleep apnoea does not significantly reduce the risk of heart disease.

This study will recruit 200 participants over a period of 18 months. The research team will observe the heart rhythms of sleep apnoea patients by inserting an implantable loop recorder (ILR) in up to 100 participants. The other 100 patients will simply have standard care. This device will monitor the heart continuously for 3 years allowing us to detect abnormal heart rhythms and treat as necessary.

Demonstrating the incidence of arrhythmia can lead onto a larger study which may change future sleep apnoea management improving their cardiovascular outcomes.

Although FHH is a standard component of the medical interview its widespread adoption is hindered by three major barriers: (1) a dearth of standard collection methods; (2) the absence of health care provider access to complete FHH information; and (3) the need for clinical guidance for the interpretation and use of FHH. In addition, the time constraints of the busy provider and poor integration of FHH with paper medical records or electronic medical records (EMR) impede its widespread use. The investigators hypothesize that patient-driven and electronic collection of FHH for risk stratification will promote more informed decision-making by patients and providers, and improves adherence to risk-stratified preventive care guidelines. The study team will use an implementation sciences approach to integrate an innovative FHH system that collects FHH from patients.

suPAR is a circulating protein which can be found in blood and/or urine and is associated with both kidney and heart disease.

* Hypothesis 1: Higher suPAR at baseline will predispose to Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy or heart failure, observed by histology (under the microscope and other lab techniques) in mouse models, and tested using heart ultrasound techniques in humans.
* Hypothesis 2: suPAR is a marker of Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy or heart failure after exposure to Doxorubicin, observed by histology (under the microscope and other lab techniques) in mouse models, and tested in humans.

The study will look at suPAR's association with three other biomarkers called troponin, B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and C- Reactive Protein (CRP) that are also associated with heart disease.

In this study, the patient will have blood drawn as a routine part of the cancer treatment. That is prior to starting the cancer therapy, then after the first 2 and last 2 doxorubicin cycles (4 cycles altogether); as well as at 3, 6, \& 12 months after doxorubicin treatment. (6 Visits in total) The patient will also have an echocardiogram (echo, heart ultrasound) at each of these time points.

Although there is no current consensus regarding normal suPAR blood level, a level of 3000 pg/mL is considered a high level.

Higher baseline blood level of suPAR, will predispose patients with breast cancer undergoing chemo regimen containing doxorubicin, to develop heart toxicity (heart failure or cardiomyopathy).

Heart failure or Cardiomyopathy will be diagnosed by the clinical evaluation with signs and symptoms, LVEF (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction) with echocardiograms (heart ultrasound), and surrogate cardiovascular outcome measures as described in humans, and tissue visualization and histology in mouse models, with various staining techniques, whether it was H\&E staining, or other immunological staining., 12 months|Predictive relationship between suPAR blood level and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, A blood draw will be done at baseline for all participants.

NCT02951273,Cerebral Blood Flow During Propofol Anaesthesia,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02951273,,COMPLETED,"General anaesthesia often reduces blood pressure whereby blood flow to the brain and other vital organs may become insufficient. Thus, medicine is often administered during anaesthesia to maintain blood pressure. However, it is unclear at what level blood pressure should be aimed at during anaesthesia.

Several factors may affect blood flow to the brain during anaesthesia. During surgery on the internal organs, a hormone may be released that dilates blood vessels and causes a so-called mesenteric traction syndrome characterised by a decrease in blood pressure and flushing. This reaction lasts for approximately thirty minutes and is observed in about half of the patients who undergo surgery on the stomach and intestines. It is unknown whether a mesenteric traction syndrome affects blood flow to the brain. Ventilation is also of importance for blood flow to the brain. Thus, blood flow to the brain is reduced by hyperventilation and increases if breathing is slower. It is unclear whether the relation between blood flow to the brain and ventilation is affected during anaesthesia.

This study will evaluate how blood flow to the brain is affected by anaesthesia and standard treatment of a possible reduction in blood pressure. Further, the study will assess whether blood flow to the brain is affected by development of a mesenteric traction syndrome. Lastly, the project will evaluate blood flow to the brain during short-term changes in the patient's ventilation by adjustments on the ventilator.

Thirty patients planned for major abdominal surgery will be included in the project. The study will take place from the patient's arrival at the operation room and until two hours after the start of surgery. Placement of catheters and anaesthesia are according to standard care.

Peak exercise cardiac output was measured in a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam., 6 months after treatment|Arteriovenous Oxygen Difference (A-V O2) (Exercise Capacity Addendum), Arteriovenous Oxygen Difference (A-V O2) is the difference in oxygen levels between arterial blood and venous blood. A-V O2 difference is important because it reflects how much oxygen is being used by the body's tissues during exercise or physical activity. A higher A-V O2 difference is generally considered better., 6 months after treatment initiation|Maximum Rate of Oxygen Consumption (VO2) (Exercise Capacity Addendum), Maximum rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) is an objective measure of cardiorespiratory fitness. VO2 was assessed with a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Higher VO2 represents greater cardiorespiratory fitness., 6 months after treatment initiation|Left Ventricular Function (Exercise Capacity Addendum), Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, %) is a measure of cardiac function. LVEF was assessed with a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam. The higher the LVEF, the more efficiently the heart is at pumping blood to the rest of the body with every heart beat., 6 months after treatment initiation|Cognitive Function- Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) Test (Exercise Capacity Addendum), The COWA test was used to assess cognitive function and verbal fluency. Participants were asked to produce as many words as they can that begin with the given letter (i.e. T or L) within a 1-min time period. The COWA test total score was measured by summing the total number of acceptable words produced for three different letters. Minimum possible score for the COWA text is 0.

NCT02496260,Biomarkers and Cardiac MRI as Early Indicators of Cardiac Exposure Following Breast Radiotherapy,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02496260,,COMPLETED,"Radiotherapy plays an integral role in breast cancer therapy. Multiple randomized studies have demonstrated decreased local-regional recurrence rates and decreased breast-cancer mortality. However, balanced with this survival benefit is the potential toxicity of the treatment itself. In particular, cardiac effects of radiotherapy have been a concern and an area of research for the past 20 years. From long-term follow up of patients with lymphoma, it is known that radiotherapy can lead to increased risk of myocardial infarction, valvular dysfunction, systolic and diastolic function abnormalities, and heart failure among cancer-survivors. Patients with breast cancer receive lower doses to smaller volumes of the heart, but they also have an excellent long-term survival, so it is crucial to study the effects of low dose radiotherapy. Indeed, a recent study suggests that these effects can be seen within the first 5 years after treatment, and that there is no dose threshold. This study aims to develop imaging and blood biomarkers of cardiac exposure, as a first step to identifying patients at increased risk for cardiac effects, so they can be targeted for close monitoring and early intervention, potentially with statins or ACE inhibitors. Additionally, by characterizing a time-course and radiation dose-volume relationship, potentially real-time modifications can be made to RT field design for patients sensitive to RT effects.

Aerobic exercise therapy offers a non-pharmacological mechanism to modulate multiple gene expression pathways that may promote cardiac remodeling.

NCT03089502,Efficacy of Cardio-Oncology Rehabilitation Exercise for Women With Breast Cancer and Treatment Related Cardiotoxicity,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03089502,CORE,TERMINATED,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer among Canadian women with nearly 26,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Fortunately, advancements in diagnostic tools and curative treatments have significantly improved overall survival. However, the development of cardiac toxicity (including asymptomatic and symptomatic heart failure) associated with use of anthracycline containing chemotherapy and targeted therapies including trastuzumab limits improvements in survival for women with breast cancer. Cardiac toxicity is a life threatening complication that leads to reduced physical functioning and quality of life. The increased risk is associated with shared risk factors among cancer and heart failure and the direct influence of cancer therapy on the cardiovascular system. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) (including exercise training and education/counselling) has been shown to improve health outcomes, reduce heart failure related hospitalizations and modestly improve mortality among individuals with non-treatment related heart failure and may benefit women with breast cancer and treatment related cardiac toxicity (BC-CT). Therefore, this single centre, randomized control trial aims to determine if participation in an exercise based CR program can improve cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiovascular function/structure and health, and quality of life among women with BC-CT.",NO,"Breast Cancer|Left Ventricular Dysfunction|Heart Failure, Systolic",OTHER: Exercise Rehabilitation,"Cardiopulmonary Fitness, A cardiopulmonary exercise test will be completed following the Bruce or modified Bruce protocol.

The aim of the Informal Carers of Elderly Cohort is to define, through a longitudinal study of their life course, the profiles of caregivers of patients with a diagnosis of one of the following diseases: cancer (breast, prostate, colon-rectum), neuro-degenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and similar diseases), neuro-vascular diseases (Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)), Age-related Macular Degeneration(AMD) and heart disease (heart failure), aged ≥ 60 years old and living in Burgundy or Franche-Comte. By following the different phases of the caregiving relationship from the announcement of the diagnosis, it will be possible to assess the quality of life of caregivers and evaluate the implementation of a pragmatic social action to help informal caregivers through a randomized intervention trial nested in the cohort.

CAD is a disease in which there is a narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries (blood vessels that carry blood and oxygen to the heart) and patients who have undergone a stem cell transplant are at an especially high risk for CAD.

NCT03474458,A Trial of Doxycycline vs. Standard Supportive Therapy in Newly-diagnosed Cardiac AL Amyloidosis Patients Undergoing Bortezomib-based Therapy,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03474458,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Systemic amyloidoses are rare diseases affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 persons each year.

In systemic amyloidoses abnormal proteins deposit in bodily organs and severely impair their function, causing death if not treated effectively. Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is caused by a usually small population of plasma cells (the cells that produce antibodies). These cells produce part of antibodies, the light chains (LC) that form amyloid deposits. Almost every organ, with the exception of the brain, can be affected by AL amyloidosis. The heart is involved in three fourths of patients and is responsible for almost all the deaths occurring in the first 6 months after diagnosis. Current therapy of AL amyloidosis is based on drugs targeting the plasma cells producing the amyloid-forming LC. At present, most patients receive a powerful anti-plasma cell drug, bortezomib, as part of their initial treatment. However, bortezomib-based therapy, can improve heart involvement only in less than one third of patients with AL amyloidosis, and many patients (approximately one third) still die within 12 months from diagnosis. Early cardiac deaths remain an acute unmet need and the major determinant of overall outcome in this disease. Thus, there is the need of alternative means to treat heart involvement in AL amyloidosis. Doxycycline is a widely used, well tolerated, antibiotic that has been marketed for decades and used to treat a number of different infectious diseases caused by bacteria. This molecule has been extensively studied in the laboratory, in animal models and, more recently, in small studies involving patients, for its potential of improving cardiac damage in amyloidosis. These studies showed that doxycycline disrupts amyloid deposits, reduces the amyloid load in a mouse model, and counteracts the toxicity exerted by amyloid-forming LCs on C. elegans, a worm whose pharynx is used as a model resembling human heart. In a small clinical study, doxycycline was given to patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis during treatment for their underlying plasma cell disease. This resulted in a remarkable improvement of survival compared to ""matched historical controls"" (i.e. similar patients who had received only anti-plasma cell therapy without doxycycline in the past). Based on these promising preliminary results, we designed the present clinical trial to assess whether the addition of doxycycline to anti-plasma cell therapy can improve survival in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis who were not previously treated. The rate of survival at 12 months will be compared in patients receiving doxycycline and in controls receiving standard antibiotic therapy, together with anti-plasma cell therapy. Patients will be assessed for parameters of plasma cell disease, heart involvement and possible involvement of other organs, as well as for quality of life. To make sure that patients who will receive doxycycline and those who will not have comparable severity of cardiac disease, patients will be stratified according to the stage of cardiac involvement. Patients with very advanced heart dysfunction will not be enrolled in the trial, because preliminary data indicate that doxycycline is of little or no benefit in these subjects. Patients will be randomized to receive doxycycline or standard antibiotics in combination with anti-plasma cell therapy. Bortezomib-based treatment directed against plasma cells will be delivered according to each participating institutions' guidelines. Doxycycline will be administered at a dosage of 100 mg two times a day, which is usual in the treatment of bacterial diseases. Standard antibiotics will be delivered according to each participating institutions' guidelines (provided that drugs of the same class as doxycycline are not administered) in the control arm. Patients will be provided a diary to record possible adverse events and will be instructed accordingly. Patients will be evaluated at trial centers every 2 months for treatment efficacy and toxicity. In case of unsatisfactory response second-line therapy will be initiated. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, doxycycline administration will be continued for the entire duration of follow-up (12 months).",NO,Cardiac AL Amyloidosis,DRUG: Doxycycline|DRUG: Standard of care therapy,"proportion surviving, proportion surviving, 12 months",,,IRCCS Policlinico S.

It is based on the use of antibodies that block immune system checkpoints that have been hijacked by cancer cells to benefit themselves. Blocking these checkpoints, such as PD-1, unleashes the action of anti-cancer T cells that can then destroy the tumor. The efficacy of these targeted therapies is significant, with an average 40% response rate in patients with metastatic cancers.Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are becoming a 1st line therapy in many oncology indications due to their therapeutic line in many oncology indications due to their favorable effect on the prognosis of various prognosis of various cancers Since checkpoints play a key role in controlling the intensity and duration of an immune response, their immune response, therefore, their inhibition exposes to adverse inflammatory or autoimmune effects inflammatory or autoimmune adverse effects that can be severe and sometimes lethal.Most side effects of ICIs occur within the first few months after initiation of treatment. The toxicity of immunotherapy is immunological, all organs including the heart can be including the heart, can be affected.

Cardiac autoimmune involvement in ICIs can involve the myocardium, pericardium, and/or vascular endothelium. These entities may be interrelated or, on the contrary, isolated.

Therefore, it is a major public health issue and research in this field should be a priority. Taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, are extremely powerful antineoplastic drugs, which alone or in association to anthracyclines, increase survival and lower the recurrence rate of cancer, but their use is limited by cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity can appear early or late after therapy, and may vary from subclinical myocardial dysfunction to irreversible heart failure. Currently, cardiac dysfunction induced by taxanes is diagnosed through classical echocardiographic parameters. However, these cannot detect subtle, early changes of cardiac structure and function. Consequently, description of new parameters, which could detect cardiac dysfunction in an early stage, becomes essential for detecting the group of patients at risk for irreversible heart failure. The objectives of the investigators project, in patients with breast cancer treated with taxanes, are to investigate their mechanisms which lead to cardiac dysfunction, to describe new parameters for the early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity, and to define predictive models for cardiotoxicity.

Exercise is a cornerstone of CVD prevention and treatment; yet, exercise has not been adopted as a standard of care in PAYA-CS at high CVD risk. The HIMALAYAS trial is designed to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary impact of an exercise-based CR on cardiovascular (CV) and psychosocial health, as well as CVD risk, in PAYA-CS with mild heart dysfunction (stage B heart failure (SBHF)). The primary objective of the HIMALAYAS pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a two-arm randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate impact of a 'CR-like' cardio-oncology rehabilitation (CORE) intervention on CV, psychosocial, and behavioural outcomes at 6 and 24 months, compared to behavioural support only (Support) in PAYA-CS. Screened PAYA-CS without SBHF and those with SBHF who do not participate in the RCT will be enrolled in an passive behavioural support (PBS) group. The primary outcome is study feasibility, defined according to three primary criteria (i.e., participant recruitment, safety, and adherence). Secondary outcomes include additional feasibility metrics (e.g., intervention safety and tolerability) and exploratory efficacy outcomes including peak cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak), cardiac function (e.g., global longitudinal strain (GLS)), CVD risk factor control (e.g. insulin resistance), and patient-reported outcomes (e.g. anxiety). Our central hypothesis is that the conduct of a larger phase II RCT comparing the impact of CORE versus Support will be feasible indicated by the achievement of our primary feasibility criteria.

NCT03416972,Detecting Radiation-Induced Cardiac Toxicity After Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Radiotherapy,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03416972,RICT-LUNG,UNKNOWN,"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in Canada. For approximately 30% of patients that present with locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the standard treatment is curative-intent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Outcomes remain poor, with 5-year survival of only 20%. Despite the long-held belief that higher radiation doses lead to improved overall survival (OS), the landmark randomized trial (RTOG 0617) showed the opposite. The investigators hypothesize that the inferior survival observed may be due to unexpected heart toxicity as secondary analysis revealed that the heart dose was a strong predictor of inferior OS. Up to now, change in heart function is typically detected histologically, requiring autopsy tissue. Therefore, a non-invasive marker of early heart damage is required. Hybrid PET-MRI has become available in Canada only recently. The ability to simultaneously perform metabolic imaging with functional and tissue imaging allows for novel assessment of heart toxicity. The primary objective is to examine the utility of hybrid PET-MRI and DCE-CT to assess acute changes in heart function and to measure inflammation before, and six weeks after NSCLC radiotherapy. A pilot of 20 patients with Stage I-III NSCLC will be enrolled. The findings of this study will aid in the design of new studies to reassess dose escalation for locally advanced NSCLC while limiting the risk of heart toxicity. FDG PET will be used to simultaneously assess both cardiac inflammation and tumour response. Quantitative DCE-CT will also be used to measure ventilation and perfusion changes in the normal lung and tumour after radiotherapy, providing image data that can comprehensively assess both tumour response and potential toxicity in both the heart and lungs. Such information is crucial in understanding the disease and its response to treatment.

NCT02306538,Evaluation of Myocardial Changes During BReast Adenocarcinoma Therapy to Detect Cardiotoxicity Earlier With MRI,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02306538,EMBRACE-MRI,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst Canadian women. 15-20% of early breast cancers have high levels of a protein called HER2 which is associated with worse survival. Treatment of these patients with anthracyclines followed by trastuzumab (which targets HER2) improves survival. Unfortunately, these medications together can cause heart muscle injury resulting in heart dysfunction or failure in about 14% and 3.6% of the patients, respectively. Once heart failure (HF) occurs, about 60% of patients will not live past 2 years. Studies have suggested that patients with heart injury caused by anthracyclines may be more likely to develop HF with addition of trastuzumab. Therefore tests to find early heart injury after anthracyclines may allow doctors to start heart protective medications with the hope of preventing HF. Also, animal and small patient studies have shown that an increase in the water levels of the heart muscle (edema) may be an early sign of heart injury from anthracyclines. Cardiac MRI is a unique technique that has been shown to detect edema in various heart diseases.

The investigators will test the theory that, in women receiving treatment for breast cancer, heart edema detected by MRI at the end of anthracyclines will identify patients who will later develop heart dysfunction. MRI studies with novel techniques will be done pre-therapy, after anthracyclines, during herceptin, and at end of all therapy. The investigators will compare patients with and without heart dysfunction to test if patients with heart dysfunction are more likely to have edema after anthracyclines. Ultimately the investigators hope to use cardiac MRI to identify high risk patients and study various heart protective medications to prevent HF. This will improve the personal health of cancer patients by allowing them to live free of heart disease after their cancer therapy. Ultimately at a population level this will allow doctors to provide care that can be uniquely designed for each patient based on their individual risk.

NCT05851053,Breast Cancer Long-term Outcomes on Cardiac Functioning: a Longitudinal Study,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05851053,BLOC-II,RECRUITING,"Rationale: In addition to surgery, effective breast cancer (BC) treatment typically requires chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. However, it is still unclear whether patients with BC are at increased risk of long-term cardiac dysfunction due to the adverse effects of these therapies. In a cross-sectional study in primary care, a comparison on cardiac dysfunction between 350 BC survivors and 350 age- and general practitioner (GP)- matched controls without cancer was made. In that study, BC survivors were at increased risk of mild systolic cardiac dysfunction (left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF)\< 54%). By contrast, there was no significant difference in an LVEF \< 50% or in diastolic dysfunction. To date it remains uncertain whether the mild or subclinical dysfunction we observed predicts further cardiac deterioration. Consequently, the translation of these results into guidelines for the daily practice of the GP is unclear.

Objective: The aim of the here proposed study is to clarify whether cardiac function in survivors of BC should be monitored by GPs, by assessing whether an unselected population of long-term BC survivors is at increased risk of developing cardiac dysfunction, whether in this group at-risk subgroups exists, and what factors are associated with the highest risk.

Study design: A new assessment of cardiac function among women included in the BLOC-I study. This produces a longitudinal matched cohort design consisting of two cohorts in primary care.

Study population: Survivors of BC, diagnosed ≥11 years ago who received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and a matched reference population with no history of cancer. All participants participated in the Breast cancer Long-term Outcome of Cardiac function (BLOC-I) study.

NCT03308773,Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice Base on Patient Specific Physiology,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03308773,STOPDISEASE,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"It is well known that the Type 2 diabetes and vascular disease are preceded by over ten years by metabolic dysfunction and anatomic changes that can be quantified. In order to develop effective preventive strategies and reduce the cost burden to the health care system, recognition of the earliest pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes and vascular disease is clinically relevant. The interval retrospective evaluation of data from patient records, reflect the effectiveness of the various treatments implemented in clinical practice.

Prevalence of ""prediabetes"" among American adults is estimated to be \~84 million, or one out of three Americans. Over a 5-7 year period approximately one third of these prediabetic individuals will progress to type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is a heterogenous group comprised of individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and increased A1c (5.7-6.4%). Although different pathophysiologies are present in individuals with IFG and IGT, their conversion rate to overt type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is similar.

Insulin resistance is a common causal feature of many of the pathophysiologic mechanisms linking macrovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Because hyperglycemia is the major factor responsible for the development of microvascular complications, it logically follows that prevention of progression of prediabetes to overt diabetes should retard/prevent the development of the microvascular complications. From the measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels during the oral glucose tolerance test, one can derive measures of the two core defects responsible for the development of T2DM, i.e. insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction as well as the degree of dysglycemia.

By combining a standard medical evaluation with the evaluation of cardiovascular biomarkers, patients at intermediate risk of vascular disease can be identified. In these patients, carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaque evaluation is offered to attempt to clarify risk.

The investigators currently use a local hemodynamic protocol based on the data of the literature. According to this protocol, specific patients may require cardiac index and central venous oxygen saturation monitoring. the investigators chose to monitor the cardiac index (CI) with the transpulmonary thermodilution technique (TPTD) (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical System, Munich, Allemagne). The technique is based on the injection of a cooled bolus of saline into a central vein with a central venous catheter (CVC). The variation of temperature is measured with an arterial femoral catheter and allows the assessment of the cardiac output according to Stewart-Hamilton's theory. Many studies showed the reliability of this technique (Bein J Cardio Thorac Vasc Anesth 2004, Buhre Cardio thorac vasc anesth 1999, Felbinger J Clin ANesth 2005, Felbinger TW J Clin Anetsh 2002, Godie O Ann Thorac Surg 1999).

In our institute, most of the patients are fitted with a port for chemotherapy or parenteral nutrition. When PiCCO monitoring is necessary, a central venous catheter is inserted on the opposite side of the permanent implantable venous port. Indeed, insertion of the CVC can be more difficult because of the port. It may be interesting to use the port for TPTD in order to avoid the insertion of a new CVC. This would be possible only if the measurement of CI by the port was as reliable as the classical measurement with a CVC.

The aim of this study was to assess whether measurement of the CI by TPTD was possible and reliable via the port.

It has been well established that self-management support is an effective strategy to enhance medication adherence for patients with chronic conditions. However, little is known about the effect of the medication self-management intervention in Adult patients with multimorbidity. The aim of this study to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-led medication self-management intervention in improving medication adherence and health outcomes in adult patients with multimorbidity.

Methods This study is a single centre, single-blind, two-arm randomised controlled trial. Adult patients with multi-morbidity will be recruited from NCCCR Qatar. A total of 100 participants will be randomly allocated to receive standard care or standard care plus the medication self-management intervention. The intervention will be delivered by clinical nurse specialists. The 6-week intervention includes three face-to-face education sessions (2st week, 4rd week and 6th week) and two weekly (8th week and 10 week) follow-up phone calls. Participants in the control group continue to receive all respects of standard care offered by healthcare providers, including chronic disease management, drug prescription, referral to hospital specialists, health education and consultations regarding patients' diseases and treatments during centre visits.

Outcome The primary outcome is medication adherence as measured by the 8-item Medication Adherence Report Scale.

As affordable sequencing platforms become more widely available, the advancement of biomedical science will draw increasingly on whole genome sequencing research requiring large cohorts of diverse populations. Key policy, ethical and legal implications of these developments will need to be understood in order to promote the efficacy and effectiveness of genomic research going forward.

An overall aim of this project is to obtain feedback on the informed consent process from some of the earliest particpants in studies using whole genome sequencing. A more specific goal is to characterize the salient personal and public references accessed by participants around the time of the informed consent process. By highlighting trends in participants views about study participation around the time of the initial informed consent process, we aim to advance the development of an ethically and socially relevant vocabulary with which to negotiate future terms of use for personal sequence data in genomic research.

Many people receive treatments called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies for their breast cancer, however these can affect heart function. This 'cardiotoxicity' is generally temporary and mild, but patients receive drugs to help their heart recover. Currently it is not known how long patients should receive these treatments. Patients with other types of heart failure are treated lifelong, but this may not be necessary here as the damaging cancer drugs have stopped. Taking drugs for many years can have an impact on people's quality of life, particularly for young patients. It is therefore important to understand the best treatment length. The investigators will study people whose heart function has recovered after HER2 therapy heart problems and are not at high risk for heart disease. The investigators will carefully stop their heart drugs whilst monitoring them closely with special heart scans and blood tests to detect problems early.

Methodology: The study presents three objectives and involves three groups of participants. Objective 1 is to develop a topographic map of pressure pain in the shoulder (using a digital pressure algometer), evaluate the biomechanics of the shoulder (using a digital inclinometer and load card), cardiorespiratory function (through frequency variability resting heart rate and distance traveled, through the six-minute walk test) and quality of life (through questionnaires of quality of life, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, upper limb functionality, fatigue and level of physical activity) between a group of women prior to the operation of breast cancer (experimental group, n = 36) and a group of asymptomatic controls for shoulder pain (control group, n = 18). Objective 2 is to evaluate the possible changes in the pain map over 24 weeks of supervised kinetic intervention (Supervised Physiotherapy experimental group, n = 18, will begin after drainage, frequency 3 times per week and duration of 60 minutes each session) compared to unsupervised kinetic intervention (Home Physiotherapy experimental group, n = 18, participants will receive an exercise booklet). Objective 3 is to evaluate the biomechanics of the shoulder, cardiorespiratory function and the quality of life with respect to the experimental group with and without kinesic supervision. To achieve objective 1, two baseline evaluations will be carried out in both experimental and control groups (considering the month prior to the surgery of the experimental group) and the average of the evaluations will be considered evaluation 1. To achieve objectives 2 and 3, evaluation 2 (after 4 weeks of intervention), 3 (after 12 weeks of intervention) and 4 (after 24 weeks of intervention) will be performed. The statistical analysis will include the examination of qualitative and quantitative variables. Statistical tests will be applied according to the normality of the data and a significance level of 5% will be adopted for all comparisons. Expected results: It is expected to identify sensory, biomechanical, cardiorespiratory and quality of life alterations in the experimental group, compared to the control group.

NCT01498276,Family Genetics Health Education and Healthy Behaviors,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01498276,,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Family-based approaches to reduce disease risk and promote healthy behaviors may be better than targeting individuals. Risk assessments based on family health history may help educate families on disease risks and encourage them to change physical activity and food choices. Specifically, researchers want to better understand the role of mothers in teaching healthy behaviors to their families.

Objectives:

* To determine mothers influence on diet and health-related behaviors.
* To study an intervention tool that connects family health history and disease risk.

Eligibility:

- 18 years of age who have at least one child living at home.

Design:

* Participants will complete a survey over the phone. The survey will take 30 to 40 minutes to complete. The survey will collect family health history on heart disease, diabetes, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer.
* Researchers will give participants a Family Health Package (FHP). The FHP will provide information on family health history and disease risk. It will also recommend behaviors that can reduce health risks.
* Two weeks after sending the FHP, participants will complete a phone survey about the FHP materials and their social networks.
* Some participants will be invited to focus groups. The focus groups will explore diet and health behavior. They will look at food purchasing and preparation and meal sharing. The groups will also discuss attitudes toward healthy eating and physical activity. Each focus group will last 1 to 2 hours.
* Participants will be asked to complete an electronic survey regarding participants health status, causal health beliefs, risk perceptions, and intentions to communicate health information.
* Then, participants will have the opportunity to use the electronic version of the FHP, which will assess family health history.
* After using the FHeP, participants will complete a short electronic survey to identify knowledge and understanding gained from the use of the application, changes in communication intentions, and suggestions for improvements to the application.
* Upon completion of the electronic portion of the study, a study team member will conduct a semi-structured interview to allow the participants to qualitatively evaluate their user experience, including satisfaction and usefulness.

NCT01708798,Study of the Effect of Eplerenone on Heart Function in Women Receiving Anthracycline Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01708798,,TERMINATED,"Doxorubicin and other anthracyclines are commonly used to treat breast cancer and other types of cancer. Unfortunately, they can cause heart muscle damage, resulting in scarring, abnormal contraction and relaxation, and heart failure symptoms. This side effect occurs more frequently at higher doses, and limits the total dose that can be given to cancer patients. Eplerenone is an oral medication that prevents or reverses heart damage in other disease states, and is commonly used to treat heart failure. This study will investigate the use of eplerenone to protect the heart from these harmful side effects of doxorubicin.

Few therapies have been shown to prevent heart damage in patients receiving anthracyclines. Small studies have suggested that other heart failure medications (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers) may reduce the incidence of cardiac toxicity, but eplerenone and other drugs in its class (aldosterone antagonists) have not previously been studied. Eplerenone inhibits enzyme pathways that cause scarring of the heart, and animal studies suggest that anthracyclines cause damage through these same pathways.

This study aims to investigate whether eplerenone protects the heart from the harmful effects of doxorubicin chemotherapy. Specifically, it will measure the effect that eplerenone has on heart muscle relaxation. It will randomly assign women undergoing chemotherapy with doxorubicin to one of two groups: one group will receive eplerenone, and the other group will receive placebo (sugar) pills. The subjects will not know which type of pills they are taking. Heart muscle relaxation will be measured at baseline, after completion of chemotherapy (8-12 weeks), and after 6 months. There will also be various blood tests measured in the study subjects, to determine whether there might be certain blood tests that identify patients at particularly high risk of heart toxicity after doxorubicin therapy.",NO,Breast Cancer,DRUG: Eplerenone|DRUG: Placebo,"Change in average E' (averaged septal E' and lateral E'), The average early diastolic tissue velocity of the mitral valve annulus measured by tissue Doppler echocardiography (averaged velocities of the mitral annulus measured at the lateral edge and the septal edge), 6 months","Development of worsening diastolic function, Development of worsening diastolic function, defined as a decline by at least one American Society of Echocardiography gradation of diastolic dysfunction, 6 months|Development of worsening systolic function, Development of worsening systolic function, defined as a decline in LVEF of ≥10% to ≤50%, 6 months|Change in septal E', Change in early diastolic tissue velocity of the septal mitral annulus (E', measured by tissue Doppler echocardiography), 6 months|Change in lateral E', Change in early diastolic tissue velocity of the lateral mitral annulus (E', measured by tissue Doppler echocardiography), 6 months|Change in E/E', Change in the ratio of early diastolic mitral inflow velocity (E, measured by pulse wave Doppler echocardiography) to the average early diastolic tissue velocity of the mitral annulus (E', measured by tissue Doppler echocardiography), 6 months|Change in E/A, Change in the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral inflow velocity (E) to peak mitral inflow velocity during atrial systole (A), both measured by pulse wave Doppler echocardiography, 6 months|Change in left atrial volume index, Change in the left atrial volume index, defined as the left atrial volume measured on the 2D echocardiogram indexed to body surface area, 6 months|Change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), Change in LVEF, measured by echocardiogram using Simpson's method, 6 months|Biomarkers, Change in biomarkers of myocardial injury, inflammation, and collagen turnover as predictors of cardiotoxicity, Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 months","Incidence of hyperkalemia, Incidence of hyperkalemia defined as serum potassium \>5.5 mmol/L, 6 months|Incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug, Incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug, including hypotension, dizziness, hyperkalemia, or renal failure, 6 months|Signal-averaged ECG (SAECG) changes, Change in late potentials measured on SAECG, Baseline, 8-12 weeks, 6 months|Exercise stress test, Change in QT/RR interval slope, exercise capacity, peak heart rate, heart rate recovery, ventricular arrhythmias during exercise, ventricular arrhythmias during recovery, presence of ischemia, Baseline, 6 months|Genetic predictors of cardiotoxicity and of response to eplerenone, Genetic predictors of cardiotoxicity and of response to eplerenone, 6 months|ECG changes, Change in QT interval, arrhythmias, Pre- and post-chemotherapy infusions (over 8-12 weeks)|Global longitudinal strain (GLS), Change in GLS from baseline to 6 months, 6 months",University of British Columbia,Canadian Cancer Society (CCS)|Pfizer,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2|PHASE3,44,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION",H12-00185,2014-05,2016-11,2016-11,2012-10-17,,2017-01-05,"British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 4E6, Canada",

NCT03166813,Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning in Childhood Cancer,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03166813,,COMPLETED,"Survival rates of children with cancers have improved significantly in the recent few decades. Nonetheless, the side effect of this class of drugs on heart function remains to be an issue of concern. Exploration of new strategies to protect the heart in the long term is therefore of paramount importance in children undergoing treatment of cancers. Previous cardioprotective interventions hav focused on changing the formulation or rate of administration of anthracyclines but with no observable benefits. While dexrazoxane, an iron chelator, has shown to reduce cardiotoxic outcomes, there remains worries of an association between dexrazoxane use and an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies. Recently, the clinical application of remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) as a non-invasive and an easily applicable non-pharmacological myocardial protective intervention has gained increasing interest. Remote ischaemic preconditioning is the phenomenon in which brief episodes of reversible ischaemia and reperfusion applied to one vascular bed render resistance to ischaemia reperfusion injury of tissues and organs distant away. It can be achieved by repeated 5-minute cycles of inflation and deflation of blood pressure cuff placed over the arm or leg to induce limb ischaemia and reperfusion injury. It is noteworthy that anthracycline cardiotoxicity and myocardial reperfusion injury occur through similar pathways. Hence, the investigators hypothesize that RIPC may reduce myocardial injury in children receiving anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood malignancies.

NCT01913769,Monitoring Radiobiological Effects in Thoracic Malignancy by Using Myocardial Perfusion Scan,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01913769,,UNKNOWN,"Background:

Chemoradiation is an important treatment strategy of locally advanced inoperable or unresectable disease. Radiation dose is an independent predictor of a pathological response. In addition, chemotherapy has further impact on the aspect of outcome. Improvements in local treatment delivery are needed to facilitate dose escalation and to minimize toxicity. There have been sequential improvements in tumor localization, radiation planning and delivery over the years. Helical tomotherapy nowadays provides the most precise data on radiotherapy (RT) dose delivered to thoracic malignancies, and allows greater sparing of the heart from doses associated with increased complications. However, heart disease shows a wide spectrum of pathologies, and multiple risk factors related. The damage of the myocytes may lead to not only myocardial perfusion defects, but also in functional deterioration, or even in biomarkers.

Since the impact of radiation-induced heart injury in patients with thoracic malignancies (including esophageal cancer, lung cancer, et al) is poorly documented, we try to delineate of RT-related cardiac effects and clinical impacts.

Objective:

This study aims to investigate the correlation of post-tomotherapy cardiovascular effects with myocardial perfusion and cardiac functional studies.

Methods:

The study plans to enroll thoracic cancer patients who will undergo local RT after complete staging. Patients will receive global risk scoring assessment (Framingham Risk Score, FRS), blood sampling for basic biochemistry, inflammatory biomarker, and myocardial perfusion image (MPI) at the time points of before and after RT. The results of MPI will be analyzed in qualitative visual interpretation of perfusion patterns, and functional quantitative data for cardiac functional parameters as well. The patients will be regular followed-up in CV OPD, following clinical judgement and guideline. The association between baseline and follow-up MPI, biomarker and clinical presentation will be further investigated.

Expected results:

We will obtain myocardial perfusion visual qualitative data in patients who received locoregional RT, respectively. These results will help in the understanding of pathophysiology, clinical management and follow-up of suspected RT-related heart disease.",NO,Thoracic Neoplasms|Late Effect of Radiation,RADIATION: Thallium-201 Myocardial Perfusion Study,"To investigate the correlation of post-RT cardiovascular effects with myocardial Tl-201 myocardial perfusion images, By literature reviewing, cardiovascular functional status in patients received helical tomography has not been fully investigated yet.

Besides hypertension, PCC patients may have subclinical to overt cardiac and vascular dysfunction, which are important to recognize to minimize perioperative morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular (CV) dysfunction can be in the form of hypertension, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias, angina and Myocardial infarction. Literature search revealed a few retrospective and a few prospective studies, including one prospective follow up study conducted at SGPGIMS to document CV changes in PCC. Our institutional study was the first to document the nature and extent of CV dysfunction and cardiomyopathy and their reversal after surgical cure. The studies revealed that PCC patients had significantly higher LV mass index, higher LV diastolic dysfunction, subclinical impaired LV systolic function. Earlier studies postulated apparent improvement in various cardiac indices even with selective α-blockade and continued after surgical cure, with near normalization at 3 -6 months postoperatively. Detailed cardiac and vascular evaluation in PCC patients can be of help in preoperative optimization of cardiac risk and may provide prognostic information The literature on PCC-mediated CV dysfunction and catecholamine cardiomyopathy is largely limited to case reports and retrospective studies, with few reports of their reversal after curative PCC operations. Whether the duration of disease influence the function of heart was not apparently addressed in earlier trials. Trials that established the differences in the degree of cardiac dysfunction between normotensive and hypertensive PCC patients involved smaller proportion of study subjects.

NCT05361811,Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Caregivers of Children With a RASopathy: An Internal Pilot Feasibility Study and Follow-up Randomized Controlled Trial,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05361811,,RECRUITING,"Background:

RASopathies are a group of genetic diseases that affect a child s development. They cause physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. Caring for a child with a RASopathy can be stressful. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a therapy that helps people become more aware and accepting of difficult thoughts and feelings. ACT has been found to be helpful for parents with high parenting stress.

Objective:

To find out if Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can help caregivers of children with a RASopathy better cope with parenting stress.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years or older who care for a child (younger than 18 years) with a RASopathy. The child must live with the caregiver at least 50% of the time.

Design:

The study is fully remote. Participants need a mobile device that can play audio and video and connect to the internet. They can borrow an iPod if needed.

Participants will download a free app called MetricWire. They will use this app to watch videos and answer questions.

The first 8 participants will be in a pilot study. They will receive the ACT intervention starting the first week after they begin the study.

After the pilot study, we will start a new phase called the randomized trial. In this phase, participants will have a 50-50 chance of being in the group that will start the intervention right away or the group that will start the intervention after about 2 months.

Participants will fill out surveys on 5 random days each week. These surveys have 7 questions and take about 2 minutes. They will also fill out 3 longer questionnaires: once before ACT begins, once just after the 8-week study period, and once about 3 months later. Questions will cover topics including:

Parenting stress

Life satisfaction

Self-compassion

Uncomfortable feelings and thoughts

Mindfulness

Participants will take part in an 8-week ACT intervention. They will have one 75-minute session with an ACT coach in the first week.

Participants will watch 9- to 17-minute videos each week. The videos talk about how to practice ACT techniques to cope with parenting stress.

Participants will have 20- to 30-minute coaching sessions in weeks 3 and 6. The coach will help them practice exercises and work through any problems.",NO,Neurofibromatosis 1|Noonan Syndrome|Legius Syndrome|Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome|Costello Syndrome,BEHAVIORAL: Waitlist|BEHAVIORAL: ACT Intervention,"Feasibility &amp; Acceptability, Feasibility defined by compliance with viewing \>50% of the weekly videos (proposed target rate of 5 out of 8 videos watched; must watch at least 80% of each video), and 70% of participants attending both coaching sessions 2 and 3.
